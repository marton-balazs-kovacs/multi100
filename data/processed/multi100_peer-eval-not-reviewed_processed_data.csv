2022.08.12. 13:09:05,LNHZJ,Barreca_JournPoliEco_2016_J999,Z3GMF,(1) Unacceptable,"The re-analysis pipeline is unacceptable for multiple reasons. First, the analyst’s description is inconsistent with the code. The text claims that indicators, state-by-month, year-by-month, and interactions of some continuous variables with month-effects are used. Presumably, the analyst meant “fixed effects” when using the word “effects”, because this is the only way that makes sense and analogous to the regression specifications in the paper. However, the code inappropriately uses the above variables as continuous regressors.

Second, the analyst plots extreme-temperature days against mortality rates by decade or sub-period, which could be helpful to reach a conclusion with respect to the testable hypothesis. However, the interpretation of the plots does not appear entirely correct, and there are no formal tests comparing regression coefficients implied by the plot.

Finally, one point that would possibly not have made the re-analysis entirely unacceptable, but which is inconsistent with the instructions of including explanations similar to a methodology section in the submitted text: the analyst uses standard errors based on an IID assumption and does not even mention the treatment of standard errors in the text, which should be standard for any analysis of panel data.",(1) It adequately follows from the results of the analysis,NA,(2) Inadequate,(1) Unacceptable,"The instructions asked the analyst to “use a 2 months temperature exposure window in your analysis”. The analyst used only the contemporaneous month. This is the decisive reason for my negative evaluation.

Other issues that, dependent on the interpretation of the instructions, may or may not have made the re-analysis unacceptable: the instructions asked to “disregard socio-economic factors and technological and public health advancements over time”. It is debatable whether the age distribution should be considered a socio-economic variable. The share of the population in the four age brackets is included in the re-analysis. Also, the exclusion of advancements over time could be interpreted in a narrow sense, i.e., to avoid explicit inclusion of measures of such advances, or more broadly as the avoidance of time trends, which would appear to me to be the natural interpretation. The re-analysis does include time trends.",(4) I executed it and I found mismatches,"“Mismatch between the results of the analysis and the reported results” may not be the right way of phrasing it, but it was the most appropriate answer to the question. The re-analysis does not explicitly mention numerical results, though it is the interpretation of results, especially of the plots produced by the code, that does not appear to be correct. Most importantly, there is a mismatch between the regression specifications in the code compared to what is described in the text. See my reply for why the Task 1 submission was unacceptable.",9,Z3GMF_Barreca_JournPoliEco_2016_J999_LNHZJ

The main claim in the paper comes from Table 3, which uses data averaged on the participant level (across all rounds). Once averaged, the cooperation variable no longer has peaks at 0% and 100%. I am therefore not sure whether the Zero-one-inflated Beta mixed model, used by the analyst, is really necessary, instead of the regular OLS regression used in Table 3. On the other hand, I do not doubt the analyst's expertise, even though I personally do not have sufficient experience in Bayesian models to evaluate all the details of the replication analysis. 

In terms of the results, I agree with the overall evaluation that the claim is correct only when the personal characteristics are included (i.e., as in Task 2, and not in Task 1). In Task 1, if personal characteristics are not included, the p-value I get from a regular OLS regression is 0.051, so just above the common threshold. Once the personal characteristics are included in the same model, the treatment effect is much more significant. This is rather surprising since only one of the 19 added personal characteristics are statistically significant (""missing degree""), and none seem to me sufficiently important to warrant inclusion in the main analysis. If only the commonly used variables for age and gender are included, the treatment effect is still not significant.

Note that the authors do report that the results are not significant if personal characteristics are not included (footnote 11 in the paper).",130,W9XD2_Bigoni_Econometrica_2015_VBx1_GTBT1

However, following these analyses, the analyst conducted a series of analysis to investigate whether other variables have a *larger* impact on turnout, or whether turnout is predicted better with/without elite proximity in the model.

My understanding is that the t-values are positive if the first group is more positive than the second group and vice versa. For instance, in the first table on p. 15 the D score “D_Asian_Black” means that Asian is the first group and Black is the second group. The negative t-value of -12.728 means that Black people favor Black people over Asian people. This is also exactly what the analyst claims when summarizing the results. However, in the second table on p. 15, the D score “D_Black_White” has a negative t-value, which would again indicate that the second group (White) is preferred over the first group (Black). The analyst claims the opposite in the summary of the results. This applies to all three comparisons with the group “White” (i.e., the sign of the t-value does not align with the analyst’s interpretation in the results summary). Probably the D scores are coded differently than I assumed for the comparisons involving White people. Because the analyses of the analyst are overall of very high quality, it is probably just a misinterpretation on my side, but I wanted to nevertheless express my confusion about the reported signs of the t-values.",(2) Inadequate,(4) Acceptable and high quality,NA,(1) I didn’t try to execute it,NA,232,TS468_Axt_JournExpSocPsych_2018_zK2_ANL1Q

Thus, it is inherently difficult to decide how to model the data. The analyst decided to use a fixed effects regression to analyze the data. This approach has the downside that time-invariant predictor variables have a hard time explaining variance because the between-subjects variance is covered by the individual fixed effects. Thus, the analysis focuses on the within-subjects changes in relationship status. However, only for roughly 10% of the sample, the relationship status changes over time, while it is fixed for the remaining 90% (see Table 2, p. 2310 of the original paper). Hence, the fixed effects approach focuses only on a small subset of the sample and on longitudinal changes in the relationship status, which covers only a subset of the imprecise main claim of the paper.",(2) Inadequate,(3) Acceptable and medium quality,NA,(1) I didn’t try to execute it,NA,237,YSAKF_Chen_Demography_2018_yAPR_ANL1Q

Second, the re-analyst thinks that the effect sizes in significant analyses are too small, and the reason for significant results is the large sample.

The initial claim compared no high school vs college degree. In the analysis, the researcher dummy coded all different kind of schooling degrees (5 total) which were derived based on the years of schooling of participants. The result is that the dummy variable high school is significant but the college degree variable is not-significant.The analysist derives at their conclusion based on all schooling degrees although they were not included in the initial claim of the researcher

The null-hypothesis is mis-specified

Country is included as a dummy variable although it is not clear why

The categorization is wrong: frequentist analyses can never obtain evidence for the null-hypothesis

Some countries were excluded due to outliers, but it is unclear why these were coded as outliers",(2) Inadequate,(1) Unacceptable,"The researcher controlled for countries although the instructions explicitly state that one should use the pooled sample of immigrants

A 3-way ANOVA was performed. The 3-way ANOVA tests whether the experimental condition, gender and marital status affect the level of the reported desired salary. The 3-way ANOVA did not find evidence that these variables affect the reported desired salary. However, this is not exactly the claim that should be tested. The 3-way ANOVA includes data from men and married women, which are irrelevant to the claim tested.

It would have been better to only use the data from single female and then look at whether the experimental condition changes the reported desired salaries. Including the data from men and married women adds noise and makes the relationship weaker.",(2) Inadequate,(2) Acceptable but low quality,NA,(1) I didn’t try to execute it,NA,496,UDSRB_Bursztyn_AmEcoRev_2017_VB9K_03TOT
