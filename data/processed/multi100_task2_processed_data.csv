Method.
I will first conduct descriptive tests for statistical assumptions (skewness and Kurtosis) to check for normality. Next, I evaluated missing data bias by conducting the Little's Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) Test. Finally, I will run a path model and test for the hypothesized path model (see Hou et al., 2017, p. 320). A path model will be used because the hypothesized model involves two outcome variables and two serial mediators, and the hypothesized model considers both actor and partner effects on children. Path analysis can estimate these effects simultaneously. I will test this model without controlling for any covariates (e.g., age, gender etc.) because I hope to simply examine the hypothesized model from the original paper. If the path model yields a good fit to the data, I will test the hypothesized indirect effects 5,000 bootstrapping resamples. Specifically, I will test the two hypothesized indirect links: Paternal perceived discrimination at Wave 1  paternal depressive symptoms at Wave 1  Maternal hostility toward adolescents at Wave 2  adolescent's adjustment at Wave 2 (depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviour, respectively). And 5,000 bootstrap resampling will be applied to account for potential bias in the indirect effects. 

The path analysis will be conducted using Mplus, which follows the original paper. Mplus uses the full information maximum likelihood estimation method to handle missing data, which enables the full usage of all available data in the path analyses. Maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors (MLR) was used, which can also address the potential non-normality of variables (i.e., depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviours) in the model. In path analyses, both direct and indirect effects are estimated simultaneously. Inferences for the indirect effects were estimated using bootstrap resampling.

Analysis
        First, the normality assumption for the outcome variables (i.e., depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviours) is not met (skewness = .1.01 and 2.28, SEM = .13 and 13; kurtosis = 0.83 and 10.24, SEM = .26 and .26). Specifically, the data is heavily tailed with extreme outliers as most students reported a low level of delinquency. Nevertheless, this form of non-normality is accommodated MLR estimation used in Mplus (B. Muthén et al., 2016). 

Next, Little's MCAR test for missing data (using all available data) shows that the missing is not at random (Chi-Square = 907.771, df = 815, p = .013), and it is mainly driven by parents' age. When parents' age was not included from the missing data analysis, the Little's MCAR shows that the missing is random (Chi-Square = 663.278, df = 641, p = .263). Given that parents' age is not part of the main analysis, this missing pattern (of parents' ages) is acceptable for testing the hypothesized model, and the missing data will be handled using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) in the path model.

Finally, I tested the hypothesized path model using Mplus. The model fit the data only well, Chi-Square (20) = 17.63, p = .612, comparative fit index (CFI) = 1.00, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .000 [.000, .036], standard root-mean-square residual (SRMR) = .025. Next, I tested the hypothesized indirect effects. First, I tested this indirect link: paternal perceived discrimination Wave 1 --> paternal depressive symptoms Wave 1 --> Maternal hostility toward adolescents Wave 2 --> adolescent's depressive symptoms Wave 2. This indirect effect was significant, b =  0.019, SE = 0.009, p = .034, 95% CI = [0.005, 0.040]. 
Second, I tested this indirect link: paternal perceived discrimination Wave 1 --> paternal depressive symptoms Wave 1 -->  Maternal hostility toward adolescents Wave 2 --> adolescent's delinquent behaviours Wave 2. This indirect effect was also significant, b = 0.007, SE = .004,  p = 0.045, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.016].",The hypotehsized indirect effect is tested using non-parametric test (5000 bootstrapping test),"95% CI = [0.005, 0.040]; Est./S.E. = 2.097",444,df = 20 (this is the df for the path model),p-value,"The indirect effect is based on the 95% CI = [0.005, 0.040].","The results supported the original hypothesis, such that paternal perceived discrimination at Wave 1 indirectly predicted adolescent's adjustment (depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviors) at Wave 2 via paternal depressive symptoms at Wave 1 and maternal hostility toward children Wave 2.",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",15,1

All measured on a 9-point scale. All of them were considered as possible measures of the dependent variable ‘quantity of food’ (in size, calories or caloric contribution). The variable measuring perceived food size was selected as a main measure of the dependent variable. The variable ‘condition’ was taken as the independent variable, as it codes which participant went through each condition (Camera vs. No camera).

Some of the participants did not finish the entire portion of food. The variable 'Q30' shows the amount of leftovers for each participant. This situation was explored, finding that 12 participants had some leftovers. Among these participants the average amount of leftovers (in grams) was 14, which is 50% of the total portion (28 g.). This situation could have an impact on the perception of the amount of food eaten. Therefore, participants with leftovers were excluded. 

As the form of measurements of the dependent variables has some ordinal features (9-point scale) --albeit assuming a continuous underlying variable-- and a visual inspection of the density plots shows possible departures from normality, a two-sided, non-parametric, rank-based, Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent samples was carried out to test the hypothesis that subjects in the two conditions (Camera vs. No camera) had the same population distribution for the dependent variable.

This study tests the claim that individuals who are observed while eating recall eating larger portions than unobserved participants.

However, instead of directly manipulating the predictor variable (observing vs. not observing), the authors use a proxy in the form of a camera (presence vs. absence of camera). The experimental manipulation relies on the assumption that the presence of a camera has similar effects to directly observing them. 

Interpreting the effects of the manipulation as the effect of “being observed” is, therefore, conditional on the fact that the presence vs. absence of a camera is indeed similar to being “observing” vs. “not observing”. The manipulation is a success if participants feel observed in the presence of a camera, and don’t feel observed in the absence of a camera.

The authors did in fact measure how “observed” the participants felt. This measure can be used to compute a measure of manipulation success. 

Participants in the “observed” condition are expected to have high degrees of “feeling observed”. Therefore, the score of “feeling observed” is identical to the new “manipulation success” measure (i.e., the manipulation fails when participants in the “observed” condition have levels of “feeling observed” close to zero).

Participants in the “unobserved” condition are expected to have low degrees of feeling observed. Therefore, the score of “feeling observed” is inverted in this group to compute the “manipulation success” measure (i.e., the manipulation fails when participants in the “unobserved” condition have levels of “feeling observed” close to nine). 

The hypothesis that being observed increases the estimation of food eaten compared to not being observed can then be tested by conducting a regression analysis with the interaction effect of the condition and the manipulation success on the estimation of food eaten, and then investigating the simple effect of the condition at the highest manipulation success level. The overall interaction is of no importance, the hypothesis only relates to the effect of the condition (i.e., camera vs. no camera) at the maximum level of manipulation success. 

To do so, first a linear model is computed with the main DV (i.e., the estimation of the portion of food eaten) as the outcome. The predictors are the condition (i.e., camera vs. no camera) and manipulation success. Using the emmeans package (Lenth et al., 2022) we then look at the simple effect of condition, when the manipulation is at its highest level (i.e., 9).

The analytic data set was finally limited to participants who identified as Black and did not identify as Hispanic.

To test the claim that members of non-dominant racial groups, specifically black people, show ingroup favoritism on indirect measures focusing on positive valence, I conducted a one sample t-test comparing the black composite MCBIAT score to 0. Negative scores different than 0 would indicate a pro-black bias on this measure.

2022-05-19T13:15:11Z,WZ1VC,Bruner_ExpEco_2017_amYY,Stata,"The analysis was performed as described in Task 1 (see response to questionnaire after task 1). The only additional step was to select one, single result, as conclusions for task 1 were drawn from the joint evidence of several regression models.

In the analysis for task 1, I used OLS regressions to examine the main result:
- Statistical significance of coefficients is determined by their t-value (condition of task 2 met)
- The claim was evaluated based on the joint evidence of several regression specifications (condition of task 2 ""single main result"" not met) 
Thus I now select one regression specification as the most appropriate to test the main claim of the paper.

Regressions in task 1 used three different risk aversion measures derived from two multiple price lists. I will use the risk aversion measure ""safe_choices"" which is the sum of safe choices in the PV MPL and RV MPL. Reasoning: This risk aversion measure aggregates risk aversion across MPLs and should thus provide a robust measure of risk aversion. Using only one of the MPLs would be somewhat arbitrary and hard to defend.

Regressions in task 1 used three different regression specifications. I will use ""full"" regression specification with treatment indicators and controls. This mitigates concerns that treatment indicators or control variables influence the main results.

The selected regression as a single, main test of the main claim in the paper is an OLS regression with robust standard errors and decision errors as the dependent variable. Decision errors are defined as the number of dominated choices on the LV multiple price list. The independent variable of interest is ""safe_choices"", which sums up the number of safe choices by participants on the RV and PV MPLs. The regression further includes treatment indicators (six treatments which only vary the order of MPLs) and 7 control variables. Control variables are participants' age and gender, indicators whether they work, whether they have studied for more than a year, and whether they have prior experience with experiments. Further controls are the self-rated understanding of the instructions and self-rated importance of earning money from the experiment. Control variables were selected based on availability, potential relation to decision errors and risk aversion, and the possibility to construct a numerical variable for inclusion in the regression.

Single, main result:
Coefficient for safe choices: -.3834327 (one additional safe choice across both MPLs results in about 0.4 fewer decision errors)
T-value for coefficient: 4.45
P-value for coefficient: .00003358 (p<.005 which was used as criterion for statistical significance)

The strength of the result gives little reason to worry about standard errors. In task 1, I ruled out clustered standard errors as treatments are assigned on an individual level (this is rather accurate even though not all 6 treatments were used in all sessions) and clusters are relatively small. Sometimes bootstrapped SEs are advocated in small samples, although they are not necessarily designed for that purpose. For task 2, I re-estimate the above described regression result with bootstrapped standard errors and find z-values>4. This is confirmatory evidence for the main specification.",t-statistic,4.447,81,67,p-value,0.0000336,"The single, main result in terms of statistical families of z-, t-, F-, or χ² tests rejects the null of no effect of risk aversion on decision errors at t=4.45 (p<0.005).",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",15,23

Thus, I standardized these variables before averaging them into the “connectedness” predictor.  

Because I planned to do a logistic regression to test the interaction effect, I also planned to do a Box-Tedwell Test to test the assumption of a linear relationship between the continuous predictor and the logit transformation of the dependent variable. Trying to do a logit transformation of a variable whose values are near zero does not work. Thus, I checked the frequencies of the standardized variables, found that adding 3 to each variable would bring all scores above zero, and added 3 to each variable.

Then I ran a logistic regression with effect-coded opportunity cost, mean_connection, LN_mean_connection, and the interaction of the latter two variables as the predictors of notbuy. The result of interest was for the Box-Tidwell Test, which was nonsignificant. This finding supported the assumption of a linear relationship between the continuous predictor and the logit transformation of the dependent variable. 

Next I standardized the connection variable to prevent multicollinearity in the logistic multiple regression containing the interaction between mean connection and effect-coded opportunity cost.

2022-05-25T16:37:11Z,YMESM,Cohen_AmEcoRev_2015_2lb5,R,"Overview: Since the outcome – self-reported treatment of an illness episode with an ACT – is binary (either an ACT was used or it wasn’t), we model the data with an aggregated binomial likelihood. That is, each row in the data set is a household. We fit two Bayesian multilevel regression models that are identical except that one collapses the ACT subsidies into a single variable and the other treats the subsidy levels as separate.

Preprocessing: In the original data, each row is an illness period. I instead preprocess the data such that each row is an household. I subset the data similarly to the original study, such that we 1) only focus on the first illness episode reported by each household subsequent to voucher distribution and 2) exclude households that were also provided with a subsidy for rapid diagnostic malaria tests (p. 627). We center and standardize age of household head for ease of prior specification.

Model (see uploaded report for formal notation): We model the probability p of taking an ACT for an illness period as a binomial likelihood, where the number of illness periods n (i.e., the number of  ‘trials’ in the binomial model) vary by household. In the multilevel linear model, each randomization stratum gets its own varying intercept and varying slopes for subsidy level. The varying effects for randomization strata ensure partial pooling across strata, such that each stratum is simultaneously and proportionally informing and informed by the average intercept and slope estimate and is facilitated via a variance-covariance matrix. Partial pooling reduces the risk of over-fitting and improves computational efficiency. We also include age of household head as a fixed effect and impute missing values in household head age with draws from a Normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation estimated from the sample. All parameters get weakly regularizing priors. While our choice of covariates is fully informed by the original study, the (aggregated) binomial likelihood, multilevel specification, standardization of age, and Bayesian imputation do not feature in the original analysis.

Statistical “test”:  I calculate a z-statistics by dividing the regression coefficient for the 92% subsidy on ACT access by its standard error. I also calculate a Bayes factor for the regression coefficient being above 0.

In the dataset, only the logarithmic value of the number of coup events was provided. These values were transformed back to the original score by computing the respective exponents (while keeping values of zero). Given the theoretically guided variable selection by Miller & Elgün (2011, see the paper for variable descriptions), I used the same exogenous variables, thus regressing coup events on the variables recent coup, recent war, relative power, polity, real GDP, ethnic fractionalization, regional conflict, and conflict ends. Conflict initiation was regressed on the variables previous dispute, ethnic fractionalization, relative power, number of borders, number of allies, regional conflict, polity, and real GDP, while using coup events as an endogenous regressor.

2022-05-25T21:03:33Z,LNHZJ,Kleven_AmEcoRev_2013_Jg9v,"R, Python","1. Variable definition and hypothesis
To test the claim “tax cut to foreigners in Denmark... changed the ability composition of foreigners in favor of higher-ability players” with a “focus on the change in top ability itself rather that the change in ability composition in your analysis” it is necessary to define what characterizes a high-ability player.
While the data available contain some variables based on the quality of the team or the country players play or have previously played in, any attempt to impose a function combining those variables would involve a lot of researcher degrees of freedom. Also, apart from the first year of treatment, those variables are affected by migration outcomes already occurring after the tax-rule change event. Instead, I use the simplest definition of high ability that is also the main measure in Kleven et al.: whether a player has ever played for their national team before the year under consideration. While this measure is likely also dependent on past migration (e.g. a player of equal quality may be more likely to play in the national team if they play in a high-quality league that gets more attention than others), this choice appears less problematic than other definitions of high ability. I define the measure of high-ability foreign players as the ratio of number of high-ability foreign players and the number of all players (# high-skilled foreign/(# foreign + # domestic) in each country. Another way to deal with the different scale of different leagues, and therefore likely different absolute changes in the number of high-ability foreign players, would have been to use the logarithm of the number of high-ability foreign players instead of the proportion among all players. The testable hypothesis would have then been different, though neither obviously better or worse given the wording of the task, from the one tested here. I discarded that approach because there are country-year observations with zero high-ability foreign players and I preferred to avoid the use of ad-hoc atheoretic adjustments such as taking the logarithm of some arbitrary constant plus the number of high-ability foreign players.

Hypothesis: The tax cut to foreigners in Denmark changed the proportion of foreigners who have represented their national team among all players playing in Denmark’s top league (which is the only Danish league for which data is available).

It is unclear when the effect of the tax cut is expected to be observed, because it is difficult for players to change teams at the time of the tax cut, whereas this became substantially easier after the Bosman ruling in 1996. However, the share of foreign players in European football leagues generally increased after the Bosman ruling, and it likely caused a larger increase in high-ability foreign players in the more attractive leagues. That implies that, even if the tax rule change led to an incremental increase in the number of foreign high-ability players in Denmark after Bosman, changes in the countries used to compute the counterfactual would also be due to Bosman, thus making any attempt at estimating the causal effect of the Danish tax change after Bosman less credible.
I test the hypothesis assuming treatment from either 1991 or 1996, and in the former case, I either use the whole data set or only data before 1996. However, I consider the latter choice to be far superior to the others and will use the result obtained for this sample when reporting the one result this task asks for. The other results are provided with the code on OSF.

2. Estimation approach
The treatment affects a single unit, the country of Denmark, such that the empirical analysis has to consist of a comparative case study. Such a study requires the construction of a counterfactual whose realization of the outcome variable is deemed to correspond to the outcome of the treated unit had it not been treated. There is no one country that would serve as the obviously best counterfactual, and there is no reason to assume that Denmark’s counterfactual change in the outcome variable should be equal to the unweighted average of all other countries, which would be the assumption when using difference-in-differences (DID). As they do not make the above strong assumptions but instead create the counterfactual as a weighted average of other units and, dependent on the method, of periods in time, synthetic control methods appear the superior choice here. I make use of the Synthetic Differences-in-Differences (SynthDID) method proposed by Arkhangelsky et al. (2021), which extends the original synthetic control (SC) method by weighting not only units but also time periods when computing the counterfactual, by allowing for an intercept such that the donor units’ weighted outcome may differ in its level from that of the treated unit, and by applying regularization when determining the unit weights. I prefer SynthDID compared to SC because it is more flexible and possesses the double robustness property. SynthDID, in its canonical form, attempts to match the outcomes and does not consider covariates, which is a difference from many applications of SC that try to match on a combination of outcomes and potentially predictive covariates. I consider using only the outcome variable to determine the weights as advantageous in the present setting for the following reasons: (i) there is a limited number of covariates available, and they appear to suffer from endogeneity as they themselves are likely affected by the treatment, (ii) the population of donor units, i.e., untreated countries, is quite limited and it is already hard to match the outcomes before considering any covariates.
In addition to SynthDID, my code also estimates treatment effects using DID and SC (matching on the outcomes in each year as for SynthDID), though I consider SynthDID the preferred method and therefore report the results of the latter.
One concern when applying any of these methods are general equilibrium effects, which imply a violation of the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). The existence of such effects in the present study is obvious, e.g., a foreign player moving to Denmark cannot play in any of the donor countries at the same time. However, this issue appears likely to be quantitatively small, such that it is theoretically but unlikely to be empirically important.
I use the country-year dataset provided by Kleven et al. that they used for their SC estimations. The dataset contains data for 14 countries, though I exclude data for Greece because that country also implemented a tax reform during the sample period. I exclude data before 1983 due to missing values for some countries, and the post-event periods last until 2008, which is the last year contained in the dataset, with the exception of my preferred specification in which, as mentioned above, the sample ends in 1995.

3. Result
When assuming that treatment begins in 1991 and the post-event periods end in 1995, the SynthDID point estimate is 0.011, i.e., a 1.1 percentage point increase in the proportion of high-ability foreign players among all players in Denmark relative to the counterfactual. SynthDID provides a point estimate without a sampling distribution because there is only one treated unit. To obtain a t-statistic, we need to rely on computing the standard deviation of placebo treatment effects for untreated countries and assume that the standard deviation of the placebo estimates gives us an accurate estimate for the standard deviation of the estimate of the treatment effect for Denmark. There are twelve untreated countries, such that the test statistic will be t-distributed with 11 degrees of freedom. The standard deviation of the estimates is 0.017, such that the t-statistic is 0.645 and the p-value 0.532.",t-statistic,0.645,169,11,p-value,0.532,There is no evidence that the tax reform increased the share of high-ability foreign players among all players in Denmark.,Same as claimed by the original study,No,Yes,30,58

2022-05-25T21:18:18Z,204TY,Cohen_AmEcoRev_2015_2lb5,JASP,"In order to test the claim “…a very high subsidy…increases access [to antimalarials]”(p. 609) I first had to operationalize what a “very high subsidy” is, and what “increased access” means. 
Operationalization of “very high subsidy”
- In the abstract (p.609) they write “…a very high subsidy(such as the one considered by the international community)” suggesting the criteria set by the international community is “very high”. On page 614 they state that “…the government-selected target prices varied across pilot AMFm countries, spanning a subsidy range from 85 percent in Ghana to 92 percent in Kenya”, suggesting 85 to 92 percent is considered “very high”. This means that 2 out of 3 subsidy levels in the article is to be considered “very high”: 88 percent and 92 percent. The third level, 80 percent, falls below the threshold of 85 and is thus not considered “very high”. 
Operationalization of “increased” access
- The term “access” is defined on p. 614 as “the share of potential-malaria illness episodes, whether truly malaria or not, treated with ACTs”. On p. 617 it is defined as “(the fraction of illnesses treated with ACTs)“ which is in accordance with the first definition. Thus, increased access means that this fraction becomes larger. 
Hypotheses tested
In my opinion, the statement  “…a very high subsidy…increases access [to antimalarials]” imply at least that there should be a difference in the fraction of illnesses treated with ACTs for two groups: High-Subsidy Group (HSG) individuals with 85 or 92 percent subsidies) and Not-High Sibsidy Group (Not-HSG) individuals with 80 percent subsidy) in that the HSG will exhibit on average a larger fraction of illnesses treated with ACTs than the Not-HSG. Thus, in terms of hypotheses and evidence, we should find stronger evidence for H1 as compared to H2:
H1: Individuals with a very high subsidy (85 or 92 percent) exhibit a larger fraction of illnesses treated with ACTs than individuals that do not have a high subsidy (80 percent).

H2: Individuals with a very high subsidy (85 or 92 percent) exhibit an equal fraction of illnesses treated with ACTs as individuals that do not have a high subsidy (80 percent).
Procedure for testing the hypotheses
Step 1: Getting the data
First, I derived the dependent variable, “access” by taking the “any illness episode reported at endline” (variable 81 in file “ACT_AllMain_FINAL_pub“) and divided that by the “number of ACT vouchers redeemed over entire course of study” (variable 52 in file “ACT_AllMain_FINAL_pub“). 
Second, I excluded all participants that also got RDT. When doing this I had 1164 households in my datafile.
Third, I excluded participants that had 0 reported illness episodes reported along with households that had blank cells. When doing this I had 1040 households in my datafile. 
Fourth, I removed four clear outliers that had access larger than 1 (e.g., had one illness episode reported but used two vouchers). When doing this I had 1036 households in my datafile. 
Fifth, since I am only concerned with households that did in fact get subsidies, I removed those without (i.e., those labeled as “500” for the variable “coartemprice” in file “ACT_AllMain_FINAL_pub“). When doing this I had 874 households in my datafile. 
Sixth, relabeled all households that were labeled “40” or “60” in the variable “coartemprice” as “HSG” and those labeled “100” as “Not-HSG”. 
Step 2: Choice of statistical inference method
After examining the distribution shapes, I decided that a t-test would be suitable, with the DV being “Access” and the Grouping Variable being “Condition” (HSG or Not-HSG). Unsure whether the zero inflation in both groups would have an effect, I decided to do two types of tests: using the standard student t-test or the non-parametric correspondence, Mann-Whitney. 
All analyses were conducted in JASP v. 16.0. I used the Bayesian tests (I generally agree with the reasons for using Bayesian rather than frequentist tests as outlined in e.g., Wagenmakers et al., 2018). Settings for the prior was set at default as I deemed it reasonable that it be broad and rather uninformative (I have no prior knowledge about research on subsidies). 
Test 1: Student t-test
I derived the Bayes factor (BF) for the evidence favoring H1 over H2 (in JASP by the BF10 when when running the test of “HSG>Not-HSG”) 
BF = .226


Means with Credible Intervals for both Groups:
 
In fact, when running additional robustness checks, evidence seemed to converge towards there not being a difference:
Bayes Factor Robustness Check
 

Test 2: Mann-Whitney
I derived the Bayes factor (BF) for H1 (in JASP instantiated by the BF10 for when running the test of “HSG>Not-HSG”) and H2 (in JASP instantied by the BF01 for when running the same test. 
BF = .191
Conclusions
The hypothesis (H1) that individuals with a very high subsidy (85 or 92 percent) exhibit a larger fraction of illnesses treated with ACTs than individuals that do not have a high subsidy (80 percent) is not more likely than the hypothesis (H2) that individuals with a very high subsidy (85 or 92 percent) exhibit an equal fraction of illnesses treated with ACTs as individuals that do not have a high subsidy (80 percent).

The available dataset consist of rated responses of the free association task subjects performed in Experiment 2, plus addition questionnaire data during the screening phase and the post experiment phase. Total sample size is 54 (29 female, age range 19-24 years old). Before performing the actual analysis, the dataset was preprocessed to screen for any potential subject exclusions. One of the key issue concerning the use of free association as an indirect test of TNT paradigm is whether subjects catch on the free association task and turn it into a direct memory test (as discussed by Hertel et al.). To check for such tendency Hertal et al. included two check items in the post experimental questionnaire (item 5 & 7), asking if subjects “…deliberately respond with word from the experiment” and “respond quickly off the top of your head”. I decided to use item 5 as the filter and if subjects respond “4 (very frequently)” they will be excluded from the analysis. After subject exclusion the effective sample size became 49 (29 female).

To confirm the group assignment, RSS and BDI measured at the end of Experiment 2 are investigated. Subjects in the Non-ruminator group reported a mean of 35.12 (s.d.=6.037) and 7.00 (s.d.=4.103) on RSS and BDI, respectively. Subjects in the Ruminator group reported a mean of 63.21 (s.d.=7.729) and 18.58 (s.d.=9.833) respectively. Independent samples t-test suggest the group differences are statistically significant for both measures (RSS: t(47)=14.210; BDI: t(47)=5.421, both ps<0.001).

As in the first task, we examined the operationalization of the constructs of interest in the original article and a codebook at first. Life strategy was operationalized via two measures to provide a “more robust measurement of life-history strategy” (p. 4). However, Mini-K was requested for the second task. Mini-K consisted of 20 items scored on a 5-point scale. A positive score indicated a slower life strategy. In an original article, the scores were summed, providing acceptable internal consistency. In a dataset, this variable is coded as MiniK_1 to 20. MiniK_Total represents the pre-computed total score provided by the original authors. 
As in a first task, psychopathology was operationalized via DSM5 to “measure intensity and frequency of symptomatology across mental health domains of 13 psychiatric diagnoses relevant to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” (p.4). DSM5 consisted of 23 items rated on a 5-point scale. This variable is coded as DSM5_1 to 23 in a dataset. DSM5_Total represents a total score in psychopathology pre-computed by the original authors

As in the first task, we decided to work with the pre-computed score provided by the original authors, but before proceeding further, we examined the internal consistency of the scales of interest. As McDonald´s omega is superior (over Cronbach alpha) with regards to less strict assumptions, we recomputed the internal consistency scores for three measures relevant for this analysis. Analysis of internal consistency indicated acceptable results for all three questionnaires (McDonald´s omega = 0.94 for DSM5; and 0.81 for Mini-K). 

For the analysis correlation analysis have been used as an analytic procedure. The reason why correlation analysis have been selected is that we think it is the most straightforward  answer to research question of interest and for corroboration of the main hypothesis: 
H: “... those with a faster life strategy report greater levels ... of psychopathology”.

Before the main analysis, we examined the descriptive statistics . As indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, the assumption of normality (both, univariate and multivariate) has been violated. After the inspection of Q-Q plots, we decided to not omit any outliers, but rather to implement non-parametric statistics – Kendall´s tau. 
 
For the analysis, all N=138 participants have been used (46 - 33% were males; 92 – 67% were females), with a mean age of 34.31 years (SD=14.74; Med=29; Min=16; Max=69 years). As we are not aware of any theoretical or legal obligation concerning the minimum age of participation, we decided not to omit participants under 18 years and work with the whole sample in the main analysis as in the first task. 

For inference, we used both, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches. To handle type I error (as the selected claim is only part of multiple results reported in the original study), we used more stringent alpha levels (α < 0.005) as recommended by Benjamin et al. (2018). For BF10 >10 criterion has been used. 

DSM5 score was negatively correlated to Mini-K scores (rtau=-0.43, p<0.001). Bayesian analysis (with default Stretched beta prior width = 1) indicated evidence for H+; specifically, BF10 = 1.51e+11, which means that the data are more than 1e+11 times more likely to occur under H+ than under H0, indicating extreme evidence in favor of H+ (non directional hypotheses has been used in analysis).",Non-parametric Kendal´s tau-b correlation has been used.,r(tau)=-0.431,138,N/A,p-value,p<0.001; BF10 = 1.51e+11,"Both, the p-value and Bayes factor have been considered (Bf for every p philosophy). Simple correlation analysis with a non-parametric Kendall´s tau b correlation coefficient indicated we can reject null hypothesis. Thus, we can conclude that the DSM5 score was negatively related to Mini-K scores (rtau=-0.43, p<0.001). Bayesian analysis (with default Stretched beta prior width = 1) indicated evidence for H+; specifically, BF10 = 1.51e+11, which means that the data are more than 1e+11 times more likely to occur under H+ than under H0. This result indicates extreme evidence in favor of H+. With regards to the interpretation of the effect size, according to standard Cohen´s criteria, this effect could be considered as big in magnitude. However, as Cohen did not mean to use his benchmarks for interpretation, we can use alternative approaches more suitable for interpretation purposes. When compared to the magnitude of the effect that can be found in the field of individual differences, present effects are above 75 percentile in this research field (see Gignac and Szodorai, 2016). Such magnitude is in line with what can be found in the field of clinical psychology (see Schäfer and Schwarz, 2019). From a practical point of view, the effect is (very) large and potentially powerful in both the short and long run, but with a potential caveat that it could be “gross overestimation” of the real effect (see Funder and Ozer, 2019 for further discussion).",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,Yes,3.5,77

A total of 1104 participants completed the questionnaire distributed in Benin in 2012. For the main analysis, I filtered the data in the following way. First, I excluded 637 participants who were assigned a different experimental condition than the three of interest: (a) ""control,"" in which participants were not given a reference to President Yayi's wife (n = 140); (b) ""wife,"" in which the text participants read mentioned that President Yayi had a wife (n = 132); and (c) ""Fon wife,"" in which the text mentioned that President Yayi had a Fon wife (n = 141). I then excluded an additional 54 participants who identified as Yoruba, President Yayi's ethnic group (this subsample was also excluded from the analysis in the main article). The resulting sample included a total of 413 participants (mean age = 32.5, SD = 10.2, 47.7% female, 152 Fon [President's wife coethnic group], 261 non-coethnic).

This analysis was conducted to verify the following claim in the abstract of the original paper: ""Our results confirm that priming the First Lady's ethnicity increases support for President Yayi among her coethnics."" To test this claim, I fitted a logistic regression model with the willingness to vote for President Yayi in elections (0 = no; 1 = yes) as the dependent variable, the experimental condition (control, wife, Fon wife) as the first predictor, and participants' coethnicity (coethnic [FON], non-coethnic ) as the second predictor. Considering that the claim refers to the interaction between the experimental condition (referred to as prime in the original paper) and participants' coethnicity (or lack thereof), I added the interaction terms between the two predictors.

I was assigned to test the following claim

“Efforts in the first stage of TS are significantly higher than in the OS treatment.”

I translated this claim into the following null hypothesis 
H0: Efforts in the first stage of TS = Efforts in the OS treatment

This was an independent groups experiment with one IV (Treatment:  OS vs TS) and one DV (Effort at time 1) which was measured on a 0-125 scale. The most appropriate inferential test for this design is either an independent samples t-test or a non-parametric equivalent (e.g., Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test). 

I identified the columns in the data file relating to the IV (Treatment) and to the DV (Effort at time 1). The data set was complete – there was no missing data. No data transformations were applied. I compared average ‘Effort at time 1’ in the TS condition to average ‘Effort at time 1’ in the OS condition. Descriptive statistics showed that ‘Effort at time 1’ in the TS condition (Median=84) was higher than ‘Effort at time 1’ in the OS condition (Median=75). Before running an inferential test, I checked the assumptions of Homogeneity of Variance and Normality. Because these assumptions were violated, I tested the null hypothesis using a non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test.

""Regime opponents who know Golos will be more likely to think that the Duma elections were fraudulent than similar opponents who are not familiar with the organization.""

2. Independent and Dependent Variables
The independent variable (IV) was whether a given respondent knew about Golos (i.e., answered the Golos knowledge question correctly or not), and the dependent variable (DV) was likelihood of thinking that the elections were fraudulent (though the dependent measure measured the extent to which the respondent felt that the elections were not free and fair).

3. The Preprocessing Steps
I first took a subset of the data set to include only the data from respondents of interest, namely, regime-opposing respondents who (1) either correctly or incorrectly answered the Golos knowledge question (IV) and (2) answered the election fraud question (DV).

4. Justification for the Analysis
•	I conducted a Welch’s t-test, assuming that the DV is measured on an interval scale. 
•	In my opinion, more proper analyses to test the claim would be two chi-squared tests below (which would produce two test statistics):
•	Chi-squared Test 1: IV = golos_correct, DV = 1 vs. {2, 3} on fraud_ordered
•	Chi-squared Test 2: IV = golos_correct, DV = {1, 2} vs. 3 on fraud_ordered
•	However, because Task 2 requires that I produce ONE test statistic, I am resorting to a t-test, treating the three levels of the DV {1, 2, 3} as responses on an interval scale.

5. Analysis
IV (knowledge of Golos): golos_correct (0 = incorrect or 1 = correct)
DV (fraud perception): fraud_ordered (“Do you feel that the Duma election… was…” 1 = “free and fair,” 2 = “somewhat free and fair,” 3 = “not free and fair”)
--> Results from this analysis were consistent with the author's claim. That is, a Welch’s t-test showed that regime-opposing respondents who answered the Golos question correctly scored higher on the fraud perception question (M = 2.79, SD = 0.45) than regime-opposing respondents who answered the Golos question incorrectly (M = 2.64, SD = 0.58), t(417.5) = 3.502, d = 0.28, p < .001.",t-statistic,3.502,596,417.5,p-value,< .001,"My analysis supports the author's claim.

2022-05-26T15:28:29Z,YU64K,Altmann_JournLabEco_2012_WLkV,"R, JASP","There was a total of 320 participants in the experiment. Each participant attended only one tournament session. The current analysis compared efforts in the one-stage (OS) tournament to the efforts in the first stage of the two-stage tournament (TSS1, two-stage-stage1). The hypothesis was that efforts in the first stage of the two-stage tournament (TSS1) were significantly higher than the ones in the one-stage (OS) tournament (p. 163). Tournament type was a between-subject variable (OS vs. TSS1). There were 60 participants in the OS condition and 64 participants in the TSS1 condition. One tournament session (4 participants) was missing for the OS condition since the number of participants was lower than expected. These data points were left as missing. Prior to analysis, irrelevant conditions were removed from the data set. Effort scores were analyzed for each participant and each condition. The alpha level was set at .05, and rank-biserial correlation (r) was reported for the effect size. For data analysis, R (Core Team, 2021) and JASP (JASP Team, 2022) were used.
In order to check whether the data is normally distributed, Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were conducted. Also, QQ plots, histograms, skewness, and kurtosis values were examined (see Maxwell & Delaney, 2004). According to histograms, QQ plots, and the Shapiro-Wilk test, the whole data (W = .944, p < .001)  and, more specifically, the OS condition (W = .993, p = .003) did not seem to be normally distributed. On the other hand, the TSS1 condition was likely to be normally distributed (W = .981, p = .425). Using a t-test for this data set may not be reliable since the normality assumption seemed to be violated for at least one of the conditions (Navarro, 2018). Mann-Whitney U test does not require a normality assumption; for this reason, it would be a better choice for the current data. Results of two-sided independent samples Mann-Whitney U test revealed that there was a significant difference between efforts of OS and TSS1 conditions (U = 1413.00, p =  .011, r = .264). Mean effort in the TSS1 (M = 84.81) condition was higher than that in the OS (M = 71.65) condition. 

Note: I did not take any different steps than Task 1 to complete the current task.

For each foreign player entry (n=1031), I calculated dummy variables for post-tax reform (year > 1990 = 1) and post-Bosman ruling (year > 1995 = 1) and number of years post-tax reform. To account for differences in ability among top-quality (national-team caliber) players, I treated the highest level national team level for which they played as an ordinal variable with levels: none, U16, U17, U18, U20, U21, U23, B, A. A majority of foreign players had represented their senior national team (A; n=591), while other common levels were not being on a national team (n=342) or playing at the U21 level (n=72). To assess the relationship between tax reform and ability level of foreign players in Denmark, I fit an ordinal logistic regression where national team level was the dependent variable and the independent variables were year, post-tax reform dummy, post-Bosman ruling dummy, and years post-tax reform. The key variable for the claim that the tax cut to foreigners in Denmark changed the ability composition of foreigners in favor of high-ability players was the value on post-tax reform == TRUE. Holding all else constant, post-tax reform increased the national team level of a player in log odds by 2.12 (p < .001). I also performed the same calculation using the truncated data range (1985-2008) in Kleven et al. (2013). While the magnitude of the effect associated with the tax reform was less (post-tax reform increased the national team level of a player in log odds by 1.65; p < .001), the qualitative inferential conclusion remained the same (i.e., that the claim that the tax cut to foreigners changed the ability composition in favor of high-ability players was true).",t-statistic,966.871,1031,1019,p-value,<.001,The claim that tax cuts to foreigners in Denmark changed the ability composition of foreigners in favor of higher-ability players is supported by the results of my analysis.,Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,Yes,10,90

In the first steps, the participants who displayed bad learning of game beans were excluded. In the second step, a regression analysis was carried out to test the hypothesis that for individuals low in trait self-control, the more positive their weighting bias, the more likely they were to act on their impulse to give up when frustrated. For this purpose, PROCESS v4.0 for R was employed (Hayes, 2022). Model 1 (simple moderation) was selected; the essential settings were: (1) the predictor and moderator were centered, (2) interaction probing: –1 SD, mean, +1 SD, (3) bootstrap: 10000 samples, (4) robust confidence intervals were calculated (normality was not assumed), (5) Jonhson-Neyman was plotted, and (6) random seed was 654321. The reason why this method was selected is that PROCESS seems to be the golden-standard for linear moderation analysis in social sciences. The analysis was focused on testing one of the slopes, specifically the slope in the group low in trait self-control. Importantly, if the slope in the group low in trait self-control was statistically significant, and the slope was non-significant, this would be complete support for the hypothesis.

2022-05-27T01:46:15Z,UPE13,Liu_JournMarket_2015_9DZl,R,"Liu et al. (2015) claimed that consumers who receive financial acknowledgement with trivializing compensation for providing consumer feedback to a firm feel less appreciated than consumers who receive only a verbal acknowledgement with no financial compensation. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: financial acknowledgement and verbal acknowledgement. Consumers' feelings of being appreciated were indexed using a self-reported measure comprised of three questions requiring responses on a 7-point Likert scale. A composite ‘appreciation’ score was computed by summing participants’ responses on the three questions. Thus, the appreciation scores ranged from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating feeling more appreciated. 

The statistical hypothesis (H1) was that the mean appreciation scores provided by participants in the verbal acknowledgement condition would be significantly higher than the mean appreciation scores provided by participants in the financial acknowledgement condition. Given that H1 is concerned with the effect of one independent variable (type of acknowledgement condition) with two levels (verbal acknowledgement and financial acknowledgement) on one dependent variable (appreciation score), H1 was tested using a t-test. As each participant was assigned to only one of the two conditions, a between-subjects t-test was conducted. Consistent with standard practices, results were deemed to be statistically significant if the associated p value was less than .05.  

First, the assumptions of the t-test analysis were checked. The study design assured independence of observations. Shapiro-Wilk test showed that the distribution of residuals is not significantly different from the normal distribution (W = 0.96 , p = 0.13). Levene’s test suggested that variances were not significantly different across conditions (F = 0.06, p = 0.81). There were no extreme outliers in either condition. Thus, the data met the assumptions of a parametric t-test. 
A between-subjects t-test showed that consumers who received only verbal acknowledgement for their feedback reported feeling more appreciated on average (M = 16.72, SD = 3.8) than did those who also received financial acknowledgement (M = 13.13, SD = 4.35), t(47) = 2.92, p = 0.005.

First, trial-level BeanFest data, consisting of 6 practice trials, 108 learning phase trials, and 100 test phase trials, from 74 participants were loaded. Practice phase trials were removed and all remaining trials were labelled as “seen” (i.e., beans presented in the learning phase) or “unseen” (i.e., beans that were not presented in the learning phase). Trials on which the participant provided no response were removed from the analysis (319 trials in total). The remaining data were used to generate subject-level outcome measures. These included: 
1)	The proportion of learning phase trials on which participants correctly approached a bean associated with a gain (10 points) or correctly avoided a bean associated with a loss (-10) (“learning phase accuracy” – based on ~108 trials per subject)
2)	The proportion of test phase trials on which participants correctly labelled a previously-seen bean associated with a gain as “helpful” or correctly labelled a previously-seen bean associated with a loss as “harmful” (“test phase correct recognition” – based on ~36 trials per subject)
3)	The proportion of test phase trials on which participants approached (versus avoided) a bean they had not encountered before (“test phase approach/avoid tendency” – based on ~64 trials per subject)
4)	Outcome measure 2, but split by valence (i.e., proportion of trials on which previously-seen helpful beans were labelled as helpful; proportion of trials on which previously-seen harmful beans were labelled as harmful. Based on ~18 trials per subject)

Participants that performed significantly below chance on either learning phase accuracy (binomial probability <0.05, corresponding to 49/108 correct learning phase trials) or test phase correct recognition (binomial probability <0.05, corresponding to 13/36 correct test phase recognition trials) were excluded from analysis (n=4). Next, the approach/avoid tendency for previously-unseen beans (measure 3; ranging from 1=all approach to 0=all avoid) was mean-centered (1=all approach, -1=all avoid) and adjusted for participants’ ability to learn from positive and negative feedback. To these aims, the difference between correctly labelling previously-been beans as helpful and harmful (i.e., difference score based on outcome measure 4) was subtracted from the mean-centered approach/avoid tendency. This procedure yielded an outcome measure representing an approach/avoid tendency towards new beans that was adjusted for how well participants learned about helpful and harmful beans. This measure served as the only measure of valence weighting bias that was used in further analyses.

Next, unsolvable anagram data from 74 participants were loaded. Three main outcome measure were derived:
1)	The amount of solvable anagrams that were passed up
2)	The amount of unsolvable anagrams that were passed up
3)	The sum of measure 1 and 2, i.e., the total amount of anagrams that were passed up
Participants that passed up all 24 anagrams were excluded from further analysis (n=1). 

Third, a summed score of trait self-control was created based on the 13 BSCS items (9 items were reverse-coded), with higher scores reflecting higher trait self-control. This measure served as the only measure of trait-like self-control.

After excluding participants based on the above-mentioned criteria (n=5 in total), a sample of 69 participants remained.

To satisfy Task 2 Instructions, one statistical approaches were used (also used in Task 1). The quote from the manuscript suggests a statistical interaction. That is, the association between valence weighting bias and impulse control is dependent on self-control, where greater valence weighting bias (i.e., unseen bean approach bias) is associated with poorer impulse control (more anagram passing) in people with low self-control (BSCS score).

Given the nature of all measures (continuous) I relied on a general linear model to test this interaction. In this linear regression analysis approach bias, BSCS sum scores, and their interaction predicted anagram passing. I relied on a single GLM, in which the total amount of solvable anagram passes was the dependent variable. I selected this measure because I had no a priori hypothesis about passing up solvable versus unsolvable anagrams.

In this GLM, the crucial interaction term (approach bias*BSCS) was not statistically significant: B = -0.36, 95% CI = [-1.13 - 0.41], t(65)=-0.93, p=0.36.",t-statistic,-0.931,69,65,p-value,0.355,"Based on the observed test result, the association between valence weighting bias and giving in to one's impulses was not influenced by trait self-control.",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",7,102

We included year as a control for state accountability and welfare policies (to address instructions in Task 2).

Reporting intention scores were computed as the mean of the three items making up the reporting intention measure (in the dataset, v2287, v2288, and v2289). Neighborhood poverty scores were computed as the sum of the scaled indicators comprising the neighborhood poverty factor from a larger neighborhood context scale (factor analysis conducted in previous publication). These items were percent of households that received public assistance, percent of population in poverty, percent of households headed by a single female with a child less than 18 years old, and percent of population age 16 years and older that is unemployed.

The claim I aimed to test was as follows: “We find that neighborhood poverty has an inverse relationship with crime reporting intentions.” As this claim did not explicitly note controlling for any other variables, I chose to only examine the independent and dependent variables noted in the claim (neighborhood poverty and reporting intentions). Based on instructions to ignore individual-level differences between youth within neighborhoods, I ignored clustering by neighborhood in the data and ran a linear regression model with neighborhood poverty as the predictor and reporting intentions as the outcome (I.e., reporting intentions regressed on neighborhood poverty). Worth noting is that in the original paper, the authors used logistic regression due to non-normality in reporting intention scores, thus leaving reporting intentions on an ordinal scale. As the sample size was very large, non-normality was of minimal concern, and thus I chose to retain the scores computed for reporting intentions and ran the models using a linear regression framework.",t-statistic,-5.97,1409,1407,p-value,0.00000000301,Neighborhood poverty is inversely associated with reporting intentions.,Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,Yes,12,107

The only addition is, according to instructions, specifying “a single, main result in terms of statistical families of z-, t-, F-, or χ² tests (or their alternative or non-parametric versions).”
Hence, the main result is:
Using the full dataset with outliers, type of villages’ caste domination is significantly related to households’ total income (β = 0.172, SE = 0.052, 95% CI[0.070, 0.273], t(1291) = 3.322, p < 0.001).
Without six outlying villages, this difference ceases to be significant (β = 0.068, SE = 0.035, 95% CI[-0.001, 0.137], t(1291) = 1.946, p = 0.052).

Statistical analyses
In the first step, the main file (“household.dta”) and summary data (“table2.dta”) were imported into R from the target paper (Anderson, 2011). It became evident that the two datasets differ in the number of observations. There are two fewer households in the main file compared to the summary from the table2 file. However, checking the results with the additional two households did not change the patterns of results. Thus, the data from the main file was used in further analyses.
Next, the assumptions of normality were tested regarding the variable of interest (the total income). The normality was assessed following the recommended criteria. The skewness values above |2| and kurtosis values above |7| were treated as potentially violating the assumptions of normality (Kim, 2013). Finally, the Mahalanobis Distance was calculated relying on the usually recommended cutoff (i.e., < 0.001; (Mahalanobis, 1960; Penny, 1996) when screening for potential outliers.
Multilevel analysis with a maximum likelihood estimator was then conducted. Households were nested within villages to account for the non-independence between the household of the same villages. Then, the outcome variable was grand-mean centred. In the multilevel model, standardised total income was regressed on a dichotomous predictor variable, depicting whether the given village was dominated by low (coded as 1) or high (coded as 0) caste. As a robustness check, the more traditional test was also used to test for the above relationship (i.e., a linear regression analysis). The pattern results remained the same. Hence, herein are presented the results of a more advanced approach, that is, the multilevel analysis. All the analyses were performed in R (4.1.2). The list of used packages included: haven (Wickham, Miller, et al., 2022), dplyr (Wickham, François, et al., 2022), parameters (Lüdecke et al., 2020), lme4 (Bates et al., 2015), merTools (Knowles & Frederick, 2020), ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), extrafont (Chang, 2022), cowplot (Wilke, 2020), mitml (Grund et al., 2021), lattice (Sarkar, 2008), e1071 (Meyer et al., 2021).

Results
The analysis of skewness provided evidence that the assumptions of normality were violated regarding the outcome variable (total income), indicating that there might be potential outliers. Based on the Mahalanobis distance, data from 22 households were flagged as potential outliers. However, the analysis with and without these data did not change the results. Hence, the full dataset was retained.
After investigating the villages’ residuals (the joint distribution of the random intercepts and slopes), it became evident that six villages dominated by low-caste (i.e., villages: 70, 61, 60, 84, 59, and 58) violated the assumption of normality in the multivariate group-level distribution of the residuals (Jones & Subramanian, 2019). Hence, the analyses were repeated with and without the outlying villages.
The results of the multilevel models are presented in Table 1. Households from low-caste dominated villages had higher total income than households from high-caste dominated villages. However, this effect disappeared when using data without the six outlying low-caste dominated villages (see Table 1). Thus, it seems that the six (6.67%) villages (out of 90 analysed) with 84 (6.49%) households (out of 1295 households) carry the positive relationship between the households’ income and village’s low-caste domination. The mean of the total households’ income in low-caste dominated villages in the dataset without the six villages is 4925.46 (SD = 9676.15), while across the six villages 26787.4 (SD = 33073.85). Figure 1 presents the striking differences with and without the outlying villages. Great caution is warranted in drawing definite conclusions regarding the link between the households’ income and caste domination on the village level.

H4o: The effect of achievement awards on 2001 Bagrut rates would be similar for boys and girls. 
H4A: The effect of achievement awards on 2001 Bagrut rates would be different for boys and girls.

Analyses
Mixed effect OLS regressions were conducted to test the effect of achievement awards on Bagrut rates. OLS, not logistic, regression was run to satisfy the specific instructions for Task 2. Only school level variables were included as covariates to satisfy the instructions for task 2. Since students were nested within schools, a random intercept for schools was included in the models. An initial unconditional means model showed that there were significant differences across schools. 
Model diagnostics were also run on the best-fit model. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated to check for collinearity. C-value and Somers’s Dxy were calculated to check the quality of predictors. Finally, odds ratios (OR) were calculated and the predicted values were plotted to visualize the results. 

Results

2022-05-28T00:33:18Z,ZZQGZ,Wilde_AmSocioRev_2010_4XLv,Matlab,"This paper examines the motivation behind the progressive/non-progressive votes of the bishops during Vatican Council. The authors considered two theories to explain the voting patterns: rational choice theory (RCT) and neo-instutional theory (NIT). RCT is an indicator of the efficiency and competitive behavior, whereas NIT is an indicatior of organizational behavior, rather than individual profit. To explain the voting pattern via RCT, authors chose ""percent catholic population in the voter's country"", ""if there is religious freedom in the voter's country"", and ""if there is an established religion other than catholicism in voter's country"" were chosen. As for NIT ""Stability (change in percent catholic population in last 10 years)"", ""structuration (interorganizational relations)"", and ""if the church is and incumbent organization in the voter's country"" were chosen. 
Since I do not consider myself a sociologist, I respected author's decisions on the parameter selection and kept the original set. From the dataset, I kept the bishops that voted on both sessions (for the Revelation and for the Virgin Mary issues), and whose information for all the parameters for both theories are available. After removing the bishops with missing values, a table consisting of 1627 bishops (down from the original number of 2929) was generated. Among the 7 parameters, there was no collinearity (max condition index = 9.3, indicating weak collinearity). Along with the dependent variables (vote on mary and revelation), all the independent variables were categorical except percent catholic and change in percent catholic, which are continuous. 
For each dependent variables, 5 logistic regression models were fit in order to explain the voting behaviour. Another alternative to test the categorical variables would be a chi-square cross tab test, but since there are two continuous variables, it would be difficult to include them in the same model. The models are as follows: 
1) Explaining the dependent variable with RCT parameters
2) Explaining the dependent variable with RCT models and their interactions.
3) Explaining the dependent variable with NIT parameters.
4) Explaining the dependent variable with NIT models and their interactions.
5) Explaining the dependent variable with the parameters from both models and their interactions. 
After these procedure, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of the models were extracted and used to detect the model that has the best fit to explain the voting behaviour.
For easier understanding, I will list only the BIC scores of the models, not the significance of the each parameter of the each model. This is also because the hypothesis is which model explains the voting behavior better, not which factor. All models were highly significant (p<0.001), and the individual results of the parameters were very similar to the results presented in the paper.
For the first dependent variable (vote on revelation), the model that has the lowest score was the RCT model with the interactions. It was followed by the combined model, RCT model without interactions, NIT model with interactions, and NIT model without interactions. The best model (according to the BIC value) is also RCT model with interactions in the paper. 
For the second dependent variable (vote on mary), the best model is the combined model, followed by NIT model with interactions, NIT model without interactions, RCT model with interactions, RCT model without interactions. This pattern is the same in paper. 


My results show that, overall, the best way to explain the voting pattern of the bishops is combining both theories. However, different voting reasons have different political agenda, therefore their motivation are different for each group. This can push the voters to behave more competitively or organizational, depending on the motivations. The differences in the results of different voting sessions support this. 
As suggested by the guideline for the second task of the Multi100 project, I checked the effect of structuration and stability on virgin mary votes separately. Structuration does not have a significant effect alone (t=0.32, p>0.05), but its interaction with incumbency is significant (t=3.6, p<0.001). This finding suggests that the Church being an ecumenical organization is not sufficient to vote progressively, but it must be also incumbent the voter’s country. Stability, on the other hand, is a decisive factor on the results alone (t=2.54, p<0.05), and has a negative interaction with religious freedom (t=-2.61, p<0.05), but not with countries with an established religion apart from Catholicism (t=0.4, p>0.05).
The paper underlines the strength of the NIT over RCT however, to my understanding, RCT is better than NIT for explaining the voting behavior, especially for the first dependent variable (vote on revelation).",Chi²-statistic,435.000,1627,1614,p-value,1.23e-85,"The paper underlines the strength of the NIT over RCT however, to my understanding, RCT is better than NIT for explaining the voting behavior, especially for the first dependent variable (vote on revelation).",Opposite as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",8,116
2022-05-28T01:02:12Z,QPS9D,Platt_Boustan_AmEcoJourn_2012_PVQK,R,"We begin by loading in the data files for this analysis. These are in Stata (.dta) format, so we use the haven library. Then, following the preprocessing done in the file deseg_results_aej.do, we combine the 1970 and 1980 datasets, applying various filters and transformations. 

We check for bordering areas having low populations to drop, but there are none of these.

We then check for bordering areas where only one side has data in a given year, or if data for the bordering areas is only present in 1970 or 1980. We save these to drop from the dataset in the next step.

We then create the outcome variable, which is log-transformed average home value. This follows the derivations done in the .do file, and additionally drops observations with an untransformed average home value of 0.

We then correct some data related to total population in cities, which is needed to define the urban area later.

Next, we create variables related to desegregation orders, ignoring the number of court order steps and the time since court order as specified in instructions.
We then create the following exposure variables: 
* yesorder_m: binary indicator of desegregation order on one side of border only (exposure of interest) 
* bigside_m: indicate which side of the border is bigger in population (assume to be urban centre)


We begin our analysis by examining the change in average home value between 1970 and 1980, among urban cities that desegregated.

We proceed by fitting a linear mixed effects model, with log-transformed average home value as the outcome, and a binary indicator of year (1 = 1980, 0 = 1970) as the exposure of interest. We adjust for all city border pairings as dummy variables, and fit a random intercept for all cities to account for multiple (clustered) observations per city. Each observation is weighted by the variable house_ownocc as a denominator for the outcome.

The exponentiated regression coefficient for year is then used for inference. We conclude that urban areas that underwent desegregation saw an average home value increase from 1970 to 1980 of 0.22 on the log scale, which translates to an increase of 24% (95% CI = [22%, 26%]).

Next, we compare the difference in home value changes (from 1970 to 1980) between urban and bordering suburban areas, specifically within the metro regions where an urban area underwent desegregation.

We fit a linear mixed effects model, with log-transformed average home value as the outcome, and the exposure of interest set to an interaction between (1) a binary indicator of year (1 = 1980, 0 = 1970) and (2) a binary indicator of urbanity (1 = urban area, 0 = suburban area) within a border pairing. We adjust for all city border pairings as dummy variables, and fit a random intercept for all cities to account for multiple (clustered) observations per city.

Using the exponentiated regression coefficient of the interaction, we conclude that among metros that had underwent desegregation, the urban areas saw a value increase from 1970 to 1980, but less than that which occurred for their adjacent suburban areas. Specifically, the increase in urban home values was 4% lower than that of suburban home values (95% CI = [2%, 6%]).

Finally, we compare the difference in home value changes (from 1970 to 1980) between urban and bordering suburban areas, specifically within the metro regions where an urban area did not undergo desegregation. We fit an identically-specified model as in the previous subsection on this set of areas.

Among metros that did not have desegregation, their urban areas saw a value increase from 1970 to 1980, and this was estimated to be 1% higher than that which occurred for their adjacent suburban areas, though the increase is not statistically significant (95% CI = [-2%, 3%]).",t-statistic,-3.907,8732,8674,p-value,<0.001,"We conclude that the claim “Desegregation of public schools in central cities … [leads to] urban housing prices and rents to decline … relative to neighboring suburbs” is not entirely true, based on the analysis conducted. Urban housing values in desegregated did in fact increase over the period from 1970 to 1980. This increase was lower than the increase found in nearby suburban areas. Among urban areas that did not undergo desegregation in the same time period, their value increase was comparable to that of neighbouring suburbs. A more correct conclusion would be “Desegregation of public schools in central cities was associated with urban housing increasing less in value relative to neighboring suburbs”.",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,Yes,8,117

In the two conditions relevant to the main analysis, there were 73 female participants in the first condition (i.e., stereotype not activated/ control condition) and 70 female participants in the third condition (i.e., stereotype activated by gender difference statement condition; total N = 143).
The outcome variable of interest, a summed result on the political knowledge quiz (with 20 items) had acceptable reliability (KR-20 = 0.83). Using the entire sample (i.e., including males and females across all three conditions, N = 377), I conducted two-way ANOVA (a very typical statistical technique for experimental studies involving categorical variables predicting a continuous outcome) to test whether participant's quiz scores differed by their gender, condition or an interaction between gender and condition. The ANOVA revealed that participant's quiz scores significantly differed depending on their gender (F(1, 371) = 48.21, p < .001), and the interaction between gender and condition was also statistically significant (F(2, 371) = 4.50 p = .012). However, I did not find a statistically significant difference in quiz scores between the three experimental condition (F(2, 371) = 0.50, p = .610). In relation to the main hypothesis here, these results suggest that the difference in participants' quiz scores based on their gender depended on the condition participants were assigned to.
In relation to task 2, to probe the key result I conducted a two-tailed Welch t-test to test whether the results of female participants in the first/ control condition significantly differed from female participants in the third/ gender difference statement condition. NOTE: I did not correct for multiple comparisons here, and this made a difference in terms of whether the result is statistically significant/ not statistically significant.

DATA ANALYSIS

As per instructions, the analysis will be limited to Study 1 and to the objective measure on ambivalence. I will not repeat all the considerations made in Task 1, but go straight to the determination of the main result as required.

I keep only full observations with data at both pre and post times. The sample size of valid observations (participants) is N = 174.
Variable scores are determined in the same way as Task 1. Certainty scores is obtained averaging the items, and then scaled to a standard normal for ease of interpretation. Attitudes at T1 and T2 are again obtained averaging their raw scores, but not rescaled to z scores because we want to define attitude change as their pre-post difference in absolute terms (“attChange”). Finally, Objective ambivalence is calculated using a famous “Griffin formula” (Thompson et al., 1995), and then it is scaled to standard normal.

As already noted in Task 1, attitude change, which is the dependent variable, is not distributed normally, due to being calculated as an absolute value of a difference. Therefore, I conducted a series of parallel analyses using generalized linear model with the Gamma family and a log link function, which might be better for inferential purposes. As I repeat the analyses now, however, I realize that the Chi-square value produced by the likelihood ratio test for those models is largely sensitive to the small positive constant that must be added to the dependent variable to make it non-zero (i.e., whether +0.001 or +0.1 or other), and I have no theorethical reason to chose one over another. Thus, I will simply determine the main result of interest using linear models, even though this might be a suboptimal choice in some respect. The effect of interest is an interaction, so it would be also difficult to opt for any nonparametric alternative.

RESULTS

The effect of interest is an interaction. I fit two nested models: one with (fit1) vs one without (fit0) the interaction, and I compare them with a likelihood ratio test of nested models (using the “lmtest” package of R). The test produces a Chi-square result.

After merging the monthly surveyed background variables to the personality module (surveyed once a year), I obtain a dataset of 27,015 annual observations of 8,303 individual in the time-period from August 2008 to December 2014.

The sample of analysis is restricted to female household heads or female, in the age range of 20 to 75 years, with valid information on all relevant variables and no gaps for the period of survey participation.

The well-being measure is the same as in the original article (responses on a 11-point scale to the question “On the whole, how happy would you say you are?”). As partnership status I distinguish three distinct statuses based on the civil status, information on the household head, and the relationship to the household head: “single” (neither cohabiting, nor married; potentially having a partner outside of the household), “cohabiting”, or “married”. Transitions between these statuses are used to identify observations after individuals have moved together with a partner (transition from single to cohabiting) or after individuals married (transition from either single or cohabiting to married); observations of separation or divorce and any subsequent observations are deleted. 

Finally, I control for an indicator for children in the household(yes/no), educational attainment (intermediate secondary or lower, upper secondary or vocational, tertiary degrees), whether the individuals live in a dwelling they own (yes/no), and the gross income (imputations provided) to account for variables that are associated with well-being as well as selection into cohabitation and marriage.

To test the claim that ""Well-being gains of marriage are larger than those of cohabitation"" specifically for women I first restrict the sample to observations directly before the transition of either into marriage or cohabitation and those observations directly after the transition.

## Hypothesis
**the higher endorsement of intrinsic relative to extrinsic values was indeed related to a higher willingness to pay to protect the environment (p. 472.)**

## Overview of the analysis

The analysis is composed of the following steps:

### examining construct validity
CFA was used to examine the validity of the multi-item scales to identify and exclude weak indicators (i.e., low factor loading). A range of threshold values for factor loading were considered though only one threshold value resulted in adequate model fit for the scales.     

### creating composite measures 
Variables involved in the hypothesis (intrinsic values, extrinsic values, willingness to pay) were created using the reliable indicators identified from the previous step. 

The endorsement of intrinsic *relative* to extrinsic values was operationalized as the (log) ratio between intrinsic values (composite score of the scale) and extrinsic values (composite score of the scale). Positive values indicate endorsing intrinsic values more than extrinsic values and negative values indicate endorsing extrinsic values more than intrinsic values. 

For willingness to pay which has three indicators, it was modelled as a latent variable using SEM. SEM was chosen as the appropriate modelling approach for its modelling of measurement error which could enhance the accuracy of the structural coefficients. 

### testing of the hypothesis
SEM model was conducted to examine the hypothesis. Modification indices were consulted to obtain acceptable model fit (based on CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR). 

## Model:

**willingness to pay (WTP) = relative endorsement of intrinsic to extrinsic values (IE) + sex + age**

IE = log(intrinsic values/extrinsic values)

IE was operationalized as the (logged) ratio between intrinsic values (composite score of the scale) and extrinsic values (composite score of the scale).

Note that the log transformation is to linearise the metric (so that the metric is equally affected by the numerator and denominator).

Participants, who indicated to be older than 100 years, were excluded from the analyses (one participant indicated to be 108 years old through out the waves). Participants, who indicated to be single throughout the whole survey assessment (several waves) were excluded from the analyses, as described in the original paper. Participants, who reported to have a relationship lasting longer than 100 years, were also excluded from the analyses. 
Due to the requirements of task 2, the sample was restricted only to females. 
In total, 17199 observations of 5104 participants (only females) across 6 waves were included in the analyses, whose data was available for age, well-being and relationship status (e.g. being in a relationship, cohabitation, marriage). Mean age of the sample was M=47.5, SD = 16.8, age range 15-97).   


Measures
Well-being was measured with the question: “On the whole, how happy would you say you are?”. Participants indicated their response on a scale from 0 (totally unhappy) to 10 (totally happy). Overall, mean and SD for wellbeing and for each group separately were as follows. On average, participants reported values of M=7.60, SD=1.27, range 1-10 for well-being. Participants, who were in a cohabitation relationship reported mean values of M=7.68, and SD=1.17 for wellbeing, whereas participants, who were married reported values of M=7.76, SD=1.21. All continuous variables were z-standardized, such as age. 


Inferential statistics and results
The hypothesis was that Well-being gains of marriage are larger than those of cohabitation. 
In my analysis, the independent variable was wellbeing, and dependent variable was relationship used as a dummy variable with levels of being single, being in a relationship, cohabitation and marriage. Covariates were age, number of children, education and income. Analyses were performed with plm package version 2.6-1 in R version 4.0.0 (2020-04-24). 
Prior to the fixed-effects model, I tested whether a basic OLS regression model or random effects model would be better. In both cases, comparing the fixed effects model with OLS or random-effects model (Hausman test) suggested the usage of fixed effects model. The fixed-effects model revealed that being in a relationship (r = 6.3755e-01, t= 3.9363, p= 8.574e-05), contributed significantly to well-being but not cohabitation (c = 2.6264e-01, t= 1.4947, p= 0.13515) or in a marriage (m = 2.6170e-01, t= 1.8843, p= 0.05967). However, testing differences in coefficients between marriage and cohabitation revealed no significant differences (p= 0.9955), suggesting that both contributed equally to well-being.

Welch t-Test for hypothesis testing

Liu et al. (2015) claimed that “a financial acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment with a monetary benefit) can lead to less positive outcomes than offering a verbal acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment without a monetary benefit)” (p.74). They hypothesize this claim in H1: “Consumers feel more appreciated by a firm when they receive a verbal acknowledgment rather than a similarly worded financial acknowledgment with trivializing compensation” (p. 76). 

For testing this hypothesis, I selected the Welch t-test results because the sample was unequally distributed to the conditions (nverbal = 18; nfinancial+verbal = 31). Results showed that the perceived appreciation is higher in the verbal acknowledgment only condition (M = 5.57; SD = 1.27; n = 18) than the financial acknowledgment condition (M = 4.38; SD = 1.45; n = 31). Therefore, results supported the hypothesis with a considerably large effect size (Welch = 3.02; df = 39.68; p = .004; d = .88)",t-statistic,3.023,49,39.678,p-value,0.004,"According to the results of my reanalysis of their data with Welch t-test, offering trivial financial benefit with verbal acknowledgment leads to a less positive outcome (perceived appreciation) than offering verbal acknowledgment without any monetary benefit.

I then removed observations with missing values in any of the variables included in the regression model (i.e., incomplete cases).

The analysis and the reasoning is the same as in Task 1. It is described in more detail there, but the ideal would be to investigate within-country changes in voting system. No eligible country had changed their system, meaning causal inference would have to rely on appropriate statistical control (i.e., control for potential confounders and not control for mediators and collider). There were no variables that were obvious confounders and, at the same time, were obvious non-mediators. I therefore ran two models: a simple regression without covariates, and a multiple regression with an assortment of control variables (reported in Task 1). For the ballot variable, they had similar results. Because the present task asks us to report one and only one test, I here report the multiple regression.

I ran a multiple regression with percent female representation as the outcome variable and party control over nominations (ballot) as the primary predictor. This is a dummy variable where 1 means more party centered voting.

Data selection
	We recruited a total of 826 conventional applicants (CAs) in this study. Out of those, 693 (i.e., 83.9%) referred another individual as a potential candidate. Of the referrers, 430 (i.e., 62.05%) identified as male, 254 (i.e., 36.65%) identified as female, and 9 (i.e., 1.30%) provided no information about their gender. Similarly, of the non-referrers, 76 (i.e., 57.14%) identified as male, 56 (i.e., 42.11%) identified as female, and 1 (i.e., 0.75%) provided no information about their gender. 
We compared the proportions of women and men across the two different referral groups in order to ensure that there were no systematic differences with which male and female CAs referred potential candidates. A χ2-test of independence indeed suggested this to be the case, revealing no evidence in favor of an association between CA’s referral status and gender (χ2(1) = 1.31, p = .252). This null result was further confirmed by a Bayesian test of association (using default priors and a Poisson sampling plan), producing a BF10 of .243.
Out of those 684 referrers whose gender identity was known, 394 (i.e., 57.60%) referred a male candidate, 275 (i.e., 40.20%) referred a female candidate, and 15 (i.e., 2.19%) referred an individual for whom gender was not known. As the primary interest of this analysis was to determine whether male CAs are less likely to refer women than are female CAs, we focus all of our subsequent analyses on this set of 669 CA referrers, whose referral also had provided gender information.

Are CA men less likely than CA women to refer women? 
	There were 420 male (i.e., 62.78%) and 249 female (i.e., 37.22%) CAs in our final sample. Similarly, 394 (i.e., 58.89%) of all referrals were male, and 275 (i.e., 41.11%) were female. There was thus an equal proportion of women in both the group of CAs as well as the group of referrals (χ2(1) = 0.07, p = .789; Bayesian test of association with default priors and Poisson sample plan: BF10 = .190). 
	However, this was no longer the case when considering only those 220 CAs who had been free to decide whether or not to refer a man or a woman. Whereas of the CAs in this group, 87 (i.e, 39.55%) were women, there were only 67 (i.e., 30.46%) female referrals. These proportions differed significantly from each other (χ2(1) = 9.91, p = .002; Bayesian test of association with default priors and Poisson sample plan: BF10 = 38.92), suggesting that women were being referred at a lower rate than they applied themselves. 
	Was this difference between self-initiated applications and referrals primarily driven by one gender? In order to address this question, we compared the rates with which CAs of either gender referred men and women. While women CAs referred other women at a rate of 42.53% when given the choice of which gender to refer, men CAs referred other women at a rate of only 22.56% when given the choice. Follow-up frequentist and Bayesian binomial tests indeed provided weak evidence that women referred men and women at roughly equal expected proportions of 0.5 each (p = .198 & BF10 = .349). Even more importantly, women referred other women at the same rate that they applied themselves (i.e., frequentist and Bayesian binomial tests against expected value of .3955: p = .585 & BF10 = .155). By contrast, when given the choice, men neither referred women and other men at equal expected proportions of 0.5 each (frequentist & Bayesian binomial tests: p = 1.452x10-10 & BF10 = 1.435x108), nor did they refer women at the rate that women applied themselves (i.e., frequentist and Bayesian binomial tests against expected value of .3955: p = 3.932x10-5 & BF10 = 526.882; significance evaluated against a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of .083 [i.e., .05/6 tests] to account for multiple comparisons). As such, male CAs were consistently less likely than female CAs to refer women. 

Underlying rationale for analysis choice
	Analysis choice was driven by primarily two factors: 
First, analysis was to be carried out on frequency data belonging to different categories (i.e., gender). As such, we decided between standard chi-square tests of independence and logistic regression. Given that we did not have any strong hypotheses concerning potential covariates/factors and that there were not many data points left after exclusion of subjects, we decided in favor of the former. 
Second, given that a lot of the statistical tests involved determining whether or not there was evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, we chose to include both traditional frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics.",Chi²-statistic,9.906,220,1,Bayes factor,38.924,Male CAs were consistently less likely than female CAs to refer women.,Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",8,157

After installing the necessary packages, click knit to reproduce the analyses. The analysis is highly similar to the one reported for Task 1, with the main difference being in the multilevel model estimation in Analysis 2. 
	In order to test the claim, several key variables need to be operationalized first: lower caste households will be those from BAC, OBC, and SC castes, and all analyses will be restricted to those households. Village type will be operationalized through economic power, if the majority of the land is owned by high castes, the village is ""high caste dominated"". If the majority of the land is owned by low castes, the village is ""low caste dominated"". Income will be operationalized as the total household income, since the claim does not specify the source or type of income to be tested.
Analysis 1: The analysis was performed in two parts. First, I tested whether high and low caste dominated villages differed only in caste dominance or whether they also differed in other respects (e.g. total area, type of crop grown, distance to infrastructure), which might confound village type comparisons. Using Mann Whitney U tests I found that high and low caste dominated villages only differed in caste dominance and not in any other control variable tested here. 
Analysis 2: I then assessed whether village level caste dominance affected household incomes of low caste households. For this purpose, I first removed households with missing data, and then removed outliers from the income data, and found that income was not normally distributed and was better approximated by a log-normal distribution. In order to test the effect of caste dominance on household income, I therefore estimated a multilevel generalized linear mixed model using a log-normal distribution, modelling village and state as nested random effects. This model was fitted using penalized quasi-likelihood estimation. Village caste dominance, three control variables (literacy, caste type, total village land), as well as their interactions were added as fixed effects.

However, the authors state in their readme file that the original datafile only contains the raw values. Specifically, the raw values are stored as a string forming describing the range of salary the participant has indicated (e.g., “150-175”). The original authors opted to transform these ranges into a single numerical value for analysis. They did so by taking the mean of the min and max number of the indicated range. For participants that chose “Under 75” or “Above 250”, the authors subtracted or added (respectively) 15 and took the mean of those new ranges (e.g., (50+75)/2 and (250+275)/2). In one odd case a participant responded with “Under 75 & Above 250”, which the original authors transformed to: (50+275)/2.

2022-05-30T14:19:12Z,S1LYK,Bigoni_Econometrica_2015_VBx1,R,"The analysis is run at the level of the subject per supergame, with the cooperation rate – that is, the percentage of cooperative behavior in a given supergame – as the main variable of interest. The cooperation rate can thus lie within 0 and 100 percent.

Before the main part of each experimental session, participants went through three practice supergames, which are excluded from the analysis. All other observations are included. The analysis thus comprises data from 240 participants across 23 supergames each, resulting in 5,520 observations in total. Applying analyses on the whole dataset instead of on averages per participant allows us to exploit the temporal structure of the data and control for potential learning effects across supergames. 

To test the claim whether cooperation rates are significantly higher with a deterministic horizon than with a stochastic horizon in short duration treatments, I will estimate a linear regression model using ordinary least squares. The dependent variable is the cooperation rate per subject and supergame as described above. Dummy variables for all treatments (“Short-Stochastic”, “Long-Deterministic”, “Long-Stochastic”, “Variable-Deterministic”) are included as dependent variables such that treatment “Short-Deterministic” acts as the baseline category. In addition, I control for participant demographics, their academic background and field of study, task comprehension, as well as questionnaire measures on their risk preferences, cognitive sophistication, and general trust. Importantly, I also control for potential learning effects by including the supergame ID (from 1 to 23) as an independent variable. 

Hence, the following model is estimated:

Cooperation Rate = a + b_1 I(Short-Stochastic) + b_2 I(Long-Deterministic) + b_3 I(Long-Stochastic) + b_4 I(Variable-Deterministic) + c_1 Age + c_2 Male + c_3 Italian + c_4 Education + c_5 Field of Study + c_6 Student Status + c_7 Economics + c_8 Statistics + c_9 Game Theory + c_10 Risk + c_11 Trust + c_12 IQ1 + c_13 IQ2 + c14 WrongAnswer1 +  c15 WrongAnswer2 + + c16 WrongAnswer3 + + c17 WrongAnswer4 + c18 Birthplace + 
c19 SupergameID + e

where

I(.) … binary variables taking the value 1 for the respective treatment and 0 otherwise
Age … participant age in years
Male … taking the value 1 if the participant is male and 0 otherwise
Italian … taking the value 1 if the participant is Italian and 0 otherwise
Education … enters linearly; ordinary variable indicating the highest completed education
Field of Study … enters as a factor variable, i.e., with one binary variable for each category except for the baseline (1 = Economics, business; 2 = Medicine, sciences, engineering, 3 = Humanities, 4 = Other)
Economics, Statistics, Game Theory .. binary variables taking the value 1 of the participant has already taken classes in the respective field and 0 otherwise
Risk … enters linearly; survey measure on risk attitude (from 1 to 10)
Trust …. binary variable taking the value 1 for general trust and 0 otherwise
IQ1, IQ2 … binary variables from cognitive quizzes taking the value 1 for higher cognitive sophistication and 0 otherwise
WrongAnswer1-WrongAnswer4 … number of wrong answers in task comprehension questions
SupergameID .. enters linearly; ID of the supergame (from 1 to 23)

The relevant hypothesis to test is that b_1, the estimated coefficient on the binary variable I(Short-Stochastic) is negative and different from 0. As treatment “Short-Deterministic” acts as the baseline category, a significantly negative coefficient estimate would support the claim that cooperation rates are significantly higher with a deterministic horizon than with a stochastic horizon in short duration treatments. 

For the hypothesis test I perform tests of estimates coefficients using (clustered) bootstrap covariance matrix estimation on the session and subject level using the ‘vcovBS’ command from the ‘sandwich’ package in R (Zeileis et al. 2020). This is to account for potential interdependencies between observations within a subject and within an experimental session without relying on the distributional assumptions otherwise required for standard parametric tests (see Moffat 2016, for example).

This analysis is identical to Task 1 as it already satisfies the requirements for Task 2.

This resulted in that I had a larger sample than the original authors, but the article seemed unclear on which participants were excluded and for what reason. As the OSF folder contained multiple dataset, I checked which dataset corresponded which the results of the original authors by means of the mean of the dependent variable and based on this decided on using dataset 99.
The study design described students being nested into schools and treatments were randomized across schools and not students, resulting in a logistic multilevel model. I decided to only include random intercepts and to forego random slopes because of convergence issues and because the original authors do not discuss differential effects across schools. My analysis is fairly similar to the one I conducted under Task 1, but here I excluded the logit link function from the multilevel model per instruction. I believe that the claim of the article cannot be fully addressed using the instructions of Task 2. To solely study the effect of treatment for girls, I would create subgroups. Because the instructions said not to, I opted for an interaction effect.
The claim I investigated is The experiment used a school-based randomization design offering awards to all who passed their exams in treated schools. This led to a substantial increase in certification rates for girls. 
Next, I fitted a random intercept mixed model, with the variables gender and treatment (and their interaction).

First, I visualised the distribution of the dependent variable (d12outgroup) to check its normality. Then I reported summary statistics of the dependent variable by regions (three regions) to check the homogeneity of variances. Taken together, I decided that Welch’s ANOVA (W-test) is a better alternative to Student’s t-test and classical F-test ANOVA, given the unrealistic assumptions of normality and equality of variances (Delacre et al. 2019). 

Welch's Anova test shows that I can reject the null hypothesis that outgroup contributions are equal between the three regions.  This finding appears to have been in line with the original claim. However, Welch's Anova test cannot reveal whether there is significance difference in means between each pair of regions. Hence, I checked the specific mean comparisons to replicate Table 1 in the article (testing the main hypothesis). 

Therefore, I performed Games-Howell test, which is used to compare all possible combinations of group differences when the assumption of homogeneity of variances is violated. This post-hoc test provides confidence intervals for the differences between group means and shows whether the differences are statistically significant.

Comparison of means using the post-hoc test showed that Serbs in the Primarily Albanian region are the most altruistic towards the out-group, which is one of the main findings in Table 1 in the article. However, one of my results contradict the finding in Table 1 that Serbs in the Border region are more altrustic towards the out-group than Serbs in the Primarily Serb region. 

Therefore, this replication analysis partly supports that out-group bridging norms increase with exposure to the out-group.

Paper Title: Self-censorship of Conflict-related Information in the Context of Intractable Conflict
Paper ID: Shahar_JournConflictRes_2018_J0Yv
Task 2 Instructions: Your analysis should produce a single, main result in terms of statistical families of z-, t-, F-, or χ² tests (or their alternative or non-parametric versions).
You should use Study 1 dataset in your analysis. You should use the closely related figures' answers and out-group NGOs' answers for quantifying the perception of distance from potential information recipients in your analysis.

Preprocessing:
The data file used was the same as for Task 1, and relied on the same preprocessing steps and examination of variables previously described. There were 71 participants.

Interpretation of instructions and key variables:
The instructions for Task 2 indicate that a single test should be conducted. Although the study is more complex (e.g., involves multiple conditions), only one test will be done as requested. The key test is a within comparison between two groups in the study that vary on “perception of distance,” specifically, the “closely related figures” and “out-group NGOs” conditions. As in Task 1, the closely related figures condition represents in-group information recipients and the out-group NGOs represents out-group information recipients. Thus the hypothesis outlined in the paper suggests that there will be higher willingness to self-censor (WSC) for out-group information recipients (i.e., that are relatively higher on perceived distance) as compared to the in-group information recipients. 

Statistical Analyses:
A single test was requested comparing two within-subject conditions. A within-subjects t-test was chosen for this analysis to satisfy this request, mostly because A) this study has a within-subjects design – all participants were exposed to all conditions and measures and B) it provides a test of a within-effect for the two conditions selected that is useful for the target claim. To clarify, the overall within factor (or independent variable) for this t-test is “perceived distance,” represented by two conditions that vary on this dimension (closely related figures, out-group NGOs).The outcome (or dependent variable) being assessed for each “information recipient” is willingness to self-censor (WSC), with higher numbers indicating greater WSC. The within-subjects t-test indicated a significant within effect of perceived distance on willingness to self-censor (WSC), t(70) = 8.993, p < .001, Mdifference = 1.746, Mdifference 95% Confidence Interval: 1.359, 2.134. That is, the mean difference between the closely related figures condition (M = 2.986, SE = .187), and the out-group NGOs condition (M = 4.732, SE = .163), was significantly different from zero, with higher WSC scores for the out-group NGOs condition as compared to the closely related figures condition. This result was consistent with the hypothesis above that higher perceived distance of information recipients should lead to higher WSC scores relative to lower perceived distance of information recipients. Note, although a slightly different test statistic was presented in Task 2, the same mean difference (1.746) between conditions was detected in Task 2 compared to the results of the analyses for these same two conditions performed in Task 1.

Most broadly, analyses tested the hypothesis that empathic concerns would be enhanced in situations associated with more detailed processing. Specifically, using a dataset uploaded to the Open Science Framework by Woltin et al (2011), analyses tested whether participants primed with word fragments associated with high power would show higher empathic concern compared to participants primed with word fragments associated with low power.

Empathic concern was measured using a 7-item subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1980). Prior to the current analyses, items 2, 5, and 6 on this subscale were reverse scored by Woltin et al (2011). Present analyses assumed that reverse scoring was done for these items prior to upload of the dataset to the Open Science Framework. Sum scores of all 7 items were computed for each participant, and cross-checked against the original sum scores calculated by Woltin et al (2011).

All analyses were done using R statistical software (R Core Team, 2017; version 4.1.2). First, we computed Cronbach’s alpha using the psych package to assess inter-item consistency (Revelle, 2022). This analysis confirmed the Cronbach’s alpha of 0.67 (95% CI [0.51, 0.84]) reported by Woltin et al (2011) in their correspondence with the Multi100 project. Condition labels were recoded from numeric values to “High Power” and “Low Power” for ease of interpretation, but no further preprocessing of the data was conducted.

To estimate differences between conditions in empathic concern, we fit a linear regression model. Condition (high vs. low power) was the only predictor in the model. Condition was coded as a binary predictor with high power as the default level.

Results
Ordinary least squares regression model indicated an effect of condition such that empathic concern was significantly higher in the low power condition compared to the high power condition (𝛽 = 0.4206, t(34)=2.3996, 0.022).",t-statistic,2.3996,36,34,p-value,0.022,"The current analyses indicated an effect of the power priming procedure on participant self-reports of empathic concern, such that participants receiving the low-power prime reported higher empathic concern than did participants receiving the high-power prime. Woltin et al (2011) argue that this serves as evidence that more detailed processing enhances empathic concern. If indeed the low-power prime is promoting increases in detailed processing, then the current analyses would support this broader claim. The current analyses do not speak directly to whether the low-power prime is truly promoting increases in detailed processing. However, the claim being tested here is *“empathic concerns are enhanced in contexts associated with a more detailed processing style [versus abstract processing style]”* (Woltin et. al., 2011; p. 418.), and the authors point to prior research indicating that low power is associated with narrower conceptual and perceptual focus. Thus, if the claim at hand is taken literally, then the current evidence does support the fact that empathic concerns are enhanced in one context associated (in the sense that these associations of low power with detailed processing have been argued for in prior work) with detailed processing.",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",2,177

Hispanic housing applicants are less likely to be greeted by proper name (friendliness) that were white or black counterparts.

Dataset

The provided dataset includes 1014 observations. I wanted to analyse the relationship between proper name and ethnicity of the sender, adding sex as covariate.  I selected those observations that have complete data on the variables of interest. 428 observations were excluded because of not having received any response (response_Dichotomous = 0), leading to 563 observations with an answer (response_Dichotomous = 1). Of those, additional 5 were excluded for having NAs on the variable Proper Name. This led to a final sample of 558 observations (n=196 black ethnicity, n=187 Hispanic, n=175 white).

Statistical analyses

To analyse the relationship between ethnicity of the sender and proper name, I performed a logistic regression. This is an appropriate method since the response variable, proper name, is binary. I fitted one logistic regression model (m3) that result in a single, main result in terms of statistical families. The m3 included proper name as the response variable and ethnicity as fixed factor.
Results

The ANOVA on m3 indicated a significant main effect of ethnicity of the sender (2(2, N=558) = 15.951, p<0.001).

Willingness to monitor budget was the dependent variable (mean = 2.21, sd = 0.51, min=1, max=4, N=1863). Since the effect of the information should be disregarded, participants were grouped into two treatments, either windfall or tax.

The second model, which was compared to the first using a likelihood ratio test, included the main effects as well as the critical interaction between handedness and estimated arm.

2022-05-31T03:56:40Z,58A4L,Thames_CompPolitStu_2010_l22v,R,"Because the claim depends on votes affecting which officials are elected, we include only country-years of data for which the polity2 score is at least 6, indicating a democracy.  Although the original dataset included historical (back to 1980) information about a subset of countries, the majority only had data available for more recent years.  Based on the limited historical data available and the concern that factors influencing the representation of women in legislature may be changing over time (or that time may even be an effect modifier, through its correlation with culture and other unmeasured factors), we focus our analysis on the most recent year of data available, 2004.  Although focusing on a cross-section instead of the full time series may reduce the power of this analysis, we feel it still legitimately addresses the claim while avoiding some potential sources of bias.

We used linear regression with percent of legislature who are women as the outcome.  We used the Personal Vote Index ballot score as a predictor of interest, where voting systems are categorized as party-centered (score of 0), or candidate-centered (score greater than 0).  The model was adjusted for the following continuous potential confounders: percent of women in the labor force; years since universal suffrage; size of legislature (number of seats); log of district magnitude; log of GDP per capita (constant 2000 US dollars); percent of seats for left-wing parties; and government spending as a percent of GDP.  We note that the number of seats in each legislature (the denominator for the outcome) varies widely between countries, so we calculated standard errors and test statistics using methods that are robust to heteroskedasticity.  This was a complete case analysis; any countries missing variables required for the analysis were excluded.  

This linear regression model tests whether the average percent of women in the legislature is different between candidate-centered and party-centered voting systems, controlling for the potential confounders listed above.  In other words, we are estimating the expected difference in percent of women in the legislature between candidate-centered and party-centered voting systems that are otherwise identical in terms of the potential confounders we adjusted for.  An advantage of this method is that the estimated difference is a difference in absolute percentage points, which is easy to interpret.  More complex methods may be able to leverage the data generating mechanism more effectively (e.g. binomial regression), but it may be more difficult to determine whether measured differences are scientifically meaningful.

Adjusting for potential confounders, we estimate that the expected percentage of women in countries with party-centered voting is 0.5 (95% CI -7.0,8.1) percentage points higher than that in candidate-centered countries.  For this adjusted analysis, the t-statistic for the ballot index is 0.140, and the associated p-value is 0.89.

Firstly, only disputes that had 2 years of data leading up to the dispute and 5 years after the dispute was settled were included. Years prior or after this timeframe were excluded. Additionally, disputes that had not ended in 2011 were excluded.
To be able to compare the trade imports before and after the settlement, the years leading up to and including the year of settlement were aggregated. Similarly, the five years after the settlement were aggregated, leading to a pre-post settlement data structure. 
There were duplicate disputes in the data, with small deviations between them. As it is not clear which dispute is the correctly coded one, duplicate disputes were randomly split into two different datasets and one of these sets was used for the analysis.
The data are nested within disputes and within trade partners. To deal with this nested data structure, random intercepts for disputes and for trade partners were modelled.
As this is not my field of research, I was unable to adequately judge which potential covariates should or should not be included. Therefore, it was decided to use the set of covariates from the original paper with the exception of one. In the original paper, disputed imports from the previous year were included as a covariate. As it was chosen to aggregate across years, this covariate could not be included in and of itself but was incorporated in the time variable. Thus the model looked like this:
Disputed imports logged ~ complainant status * early settlement * time  + GDP respondent logged + GDP partner logged + Democracies + Total Imports logged + random intercept dispute + random intercept partner
The model included 103 disputes with 133 partners. There was a main effect of complainant status (t = 6.98, Estimate = 2.34(0.33), p < .001, 95% CI [1.68, 2.99]), GDP partner (t = 9.86, Estimate = 0.44(0.05), p < .001, 95% CI [0.36, 0.53]) and total imports (t =18.68, Estimate = 0.48(0.03), p < .001, 95% CI [0.43, 0.53]).

For cases with missing values in other control predictors used in analysis, I imputed the mean for these variables. Visual inspection of the data suggested that any potential relation between rational justification and opinion change may be mostly driven by one particular discussion group (group 20).
I used the absolute change on the opinion scale (1-10) before and after the deliberation as the measure of opinion change. This corresponds to the operationalization in the original analysis and serves to test whether the magnitude of opinion change differs as a function of rational justification level. I want to note that the wording of the claim (""change their opinions more often"") implies a modulation of the frequency of opinion change. It seems debatable whether the magnitude of opinion change (as reflected in the change variable) can indeed be used to infer about frequency of change (see the more comprehensive analysis for Task 1 for addressing this issue).
The data was fitted to a linear mixed effects model using the lme4 package in R. Degrees of freedom for fixed effects were estimated using the Satterthwaite approximation provided by the lmerTest package. The model included a random intercept for discussion group (participants were nested within these groups). 
In addition to the critical predictor (rational justification level) I followed the original analysis in adding control predictors for gender, age, education, Catholic and Protestant faith, working-class, religiosity, left–right ideology (including a squared term), knowledge change, social conformity pressure, the intention to vote for left or right party groupings at the European Parliament elections and four questions asking whether experts, politicians, other participants or the briefing material helped to clarify thinking to the model. Furthermore, I added the opinion value before the discussion (w2pro) as a control predictor, because this may plausibly affect the magnitude of opinion change (and is, unsurprisingly, by far the best predictor of the opinion after the discussion). Categorical predictors were sum-coded and numerical predictors were centered and standardized prior to the analysis. The critical test was whether the justification rationality is a significant (using alpha = .05) predictor for the magnitude of opinion change.
Diagnostic plots suggested no apparent violation of the heteroscedasticity assumption in the model fits (even though absolute opinion change has a skewed distribution). The model fit suggests a significant effect of rational justification level on the magnitude of opinion change (t(170.0) = 3.03, p = .003). This suggests support for the tested claim. However, the data appear insufficient to estimate random variation by-group (resulting in a singular model with an estimate of zero for by-group variation). This may reflect that by-group variation is generally very low, but appears problematic given that any relation between rational justification and opinion change appears to be driven, if anything, by the results of one specific group (group 20). 
In summary, it appears that there may be some relation between the rational justification level on the magnitude of opinion change (with larger changes with more rational justification). However, this effect, if it exists at all, may not be very robust (in particular in reference to variation between discussion groups).

I conducted a logistic regression analysis to test whether performance in the trust game affects participation in a laboratory experiment. Since participation in a laboratory experiment is a binary variable(0 or 1), I chose a logistic regression analysis. Since tutors collected the data in a classroom, each participant’s responses were considered to be nested in the tutor. Therefore, I used the generalized linear mixed model with logit link function that accounts for random effects of tutor in the main analysis that tests the author’s claim.

I conducted the generalized linear mixed model with the following set of variables.
- Dependent variable: participation in a laboratory experiment(ParticipatedLab)
- Independent variables: (1) amount sent as Player A in Trust game(Sent_Class), (2) mean amount returned as Player B in Trust game with 10 dollars and 20 dollars (Return_mean_Class)
- Control variables: (1) gender(Female), (2) date of birth converted to a numerical value(Birth_numeric), (3) most common major or other(Commerce), (4) students from outside of Australia and NZ(International), (5)day of the week(Day), (6) Flyer-Trust or Trust-Flyer condition(Treatment), (7) randomly selected to be paid for the tutorial experiment(ChosenPayment)
- Random variable(random slope and intercept): Tutor(Tutor)
There is a strong correlation between the amount of return as Player B in the Trust game with 10 dollars and 20 dollars. Therefore, I used the average of the percentages of amount return as player B.

I analyzed data using the generalized linear mixed model with random intercept. The amount sent as Player A in the Trust game(β = -0.06736, z = -2.608, p = 0.00911) and gender(β = 0.60459, z = 2.127, p = 0.03341) have a significant effect on participation in a laboratory experiment.The mean amount of returns as Player B in Trust game does not have a significant effect on participation in a laboratory experiment(β = 0.33369, z = 0.401, p = 0.68870).

2022-05-31T13:56:39Z,79B6N,Hou_ChildDev_2017_YOXl,R,"The claim suggested for the evaluation includes several hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that there is only an indirect effect of the paternal (but not maternal) perceived discrimination on later adolescent adjustment. The second hypothesis is related to a specific path through which paternal perceived discrimination is related to the later adolescent adjustment. The claim implies that the described path (“earlier paternal perceived discrimination to later adolescent adjustment through paternal depressive symptoms and maternal hostility toward adolescents”) is the main and the only association between paternal perceived discrimination and adolescent adjustment. Since a single conclusion should be made and the single result should be presented, for the second task I have reported the evidence for a specific path from earlier paternal perceived discrimination to later adolescent depressive symptoms through paternal depressive symptoms and maternal hostility toward adolescents.

At the first step of the analysis model delineated in Figure 1 (Hou et al., 2017) was reproduced using the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012). Besides the connections presented in the Figure 1, covariances between parent measurements (perceived discrimination, depressive Symptoms, marital hostility, parent-child hostility) within each time point and covariances between children measurements (teen depressive symptoms and teen delinquent behaviors) within each time point were included in the model (see file model1.lav). Missing data were handled using full information maximum likelihood estimation. Maximum likelihood estimation with robust (Huber-White) standard errors and a scaled test statistic (MLR) was used for model fitting to mitigate the nonnormality of the variables. Additionally, standard errors were estimated using the bootstrap procedure. Hypotheses were tested using Wald test.
The model 1 fails the exact-fit test: χ2(38, N = 444) = 67.124, p = .002. Other conventional fit parameters are in the acceptable range: Robust Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (Robust RMSEA) = .042, 90% CI [.025, .058], p=.794; Robust Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .954; Robust Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.919; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = .058. 
Inspection of the correlations of the model residuals revealed a large number of parameter pairs that had a correlation of the residuals larger .10. Correlation residuals > |.10| might indicate poor local fit (Kline, 2015). The positive correlation might indicate that the model underpredicts the observed association between variables. Model 1 includes several pairs of parameters that have positively correlated residuals with r > .10. From the theoretical perspective it seems possible that teen depressive symptoms in the first wave (T1CESD) can be directly associated with the mother's and father's depressive symptoms (M1CESD and F1CESD respectively) in the first wave, parent-child hostility in the second wave (T2MHST and T2FHST), parents perceived discrimination (M1DISC and F1DISC), as well as teen's delinquent behaviors in the second wave (T2DELQ). Similarly, teen delinquent behaviors in the first wave (T1DELQ) might well be related to the parent-child hostility in the second wave (T2MHST and T2FHST). Based on these considerations, model 1 was respecified by introducing the direct associations between children's measurements in the first wave and parent measurements (see file model1_revised.lav). The revised model has improved global-fit tests: χ2(29, N = 444) = 23.568, p = .750; Robust RMSEA = .000, 90% CI [.000, .026], p=1.000; CFI = 1.000; TLI = 1.019; SRMR = .025. None of the correlation of residuals exceeds |.10|. 

The hypothesis about the specific indirect effects was tested using Wald test. The specific indirect effect from the paternal perceived discrimination on adolescents depressive symptoms in the second wave through paternal depressive symptoms and maternal hostility toward adolescents significantly differs from zero W(1) =4.310, p= .038.

## Data pre-processing

According to the task description, different from what I did in task 1, I need to consider concerns about institutions’ legitimacy as ecumenical concerns (embedded in a field structurated by Protestants), namely the structuration (NSTRUCTU). Therefore, the structuration should be considered the only NIT variable. Field stability (NPCCHANG) should be an interactive variable with country religion variable (Religious freedom, NRELREG2; state religion is not RCC, NRELREG4). In other words, their purpose in this analysis would be to participate in group-wise regression to discuss the situation of stability among different countries in groups. The market share would be the only RCT variable. On this basis, the country religion is actually a grouping moderator in the analysis. In addition, according to some results of analysis 1, some original variables will be included.  

For the reason above, different from task1, the variable list should be as close as the original paper but with some small changes:  

DV:  
**IREVELA0** (**Vote on revelation** - progressive/conservative);  
**IFRSTBV0** (**Vote on first BVM** - progressive/conservative);  
**IDV4CAT** (**Progressive** - ordinal manifest variable of C/P trait);  

NIT variables:  
**NSTRUCTU** (**Structuration**, the core of NIT);  
**NPCCHANG** (**Field Stability**, Change in percent Catholic);  
**NINCUMBE** (**Incumbency**);  

RCT variables:  
**NPERCATH** (**Market Share**, Percent Catholic - 1965, the core of RCT);  
**NRELREG2** (**Country attribute** - dummy: Religious freedom, *RCC is state religion* as baseline);  
**NRELREG4** (**Country attribute** - dummy: State religion is not RCC);  

However, I see **Country attribute** as the between-group moderator. That is, the dummy variables are not longer as the variables for RCT variables but for the construction of moderator. Its result would be the same as the group-wise regression with transformed **Religious regulation (three categories) - 1955**.  

Normal interaction:  
**NRELREG4 * NSTRUCTU**, **NRELREG2 * NSTRUCTU**, **NRELREG4 * NPERCATH**, **NRELREG2 * NPERCATH** (if we need group discussion);  
**XINCUMST** (Interaction between incumbency and stability);  
**XSTRUCST** (Interaction between structuration and stability);  
**XINCUMS0** (Interaction between incumbency and structuration);  

Moreover, we would have special interaction according to the analysis description that:  
**NRELREG4 * NPCCHANG** (how stability interacts with religious freedom);  
**NRELREG2 * NPCCHANG** (how stability interacts with another established religion);  

Considering that our purpose is to compare coefficient values, only the coefficients of **NSTRUCTU** and **NPERCATH** will be compared in the same regression equation. National religion will be used as moderator later for group-wise regression; field stability will be used as the normal NIT variable. According to different DVs, we will first build some regression equations containing all variables to prove/reject our claim.

In addition, same as the first round analysis:  
According to the paper's literature review, protestants concern the Mary issue more than the Revelation issue. This prior assumption gave us information that they (bishops) would be more sensitive on progress to the Mary issues. Therefore, for the same bishop with same progressive trait, the positive vote possibility of the ""Mary issue"" would be higher than the ""Revelation issue"". This conclusion implies that there is a rank in the voting behaviour since ""conservative/progressive"" is a latent trait. And we would make a bold assumption that variable **IDV4CAT** (Voting pattern on first BVM and revelation - four category) is an ordinal manifest variable measuring the ""conservative/progressive"" trait.

Due to the lack of relevant information, the pattern of missing data is assumed to be **MCAR**. Considering the sample size of this dataset is enough large to ensure the power and there is no a priori assumptions about the distribution of IVs, I would use *listwise deletion* instead of any imputation or pairwise deletion. 
## Prioritize concerns about their institutions’ legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency  
### Sources of Revelation/Overall:
We could see in this Revelation model, the SE-adjusted coefficient showed bishops who live in a higher market share country would significantly have a higher possibility to progressive vote on revelation issue (odd ratio: approximately 100%) while possibly living in a higher structuration country only contribute 9.79%. We did a t-test to compare these two coefficients manually and the result positively support that a low possibility to accept H0 ""these two coefficient are the same"" in the NHST framework (t = 3.81, p = 0.000144 << 0.005). Considering the odds ratios, I would reject the original claim in Revelation Model*""These characteristics [other crucial characteristics of the social environment within which leaders operate], which we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT) ... lead them [leaders] to prioritize concerns about their institutions’ legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency ... (p. 586.).""*.  

### Blessed Virgin Mary(BVM)/Overall: 
The BVM Model also suggests the same result (t = 2.90, p = 0.00381 < 0.05). 

### How about overall?
The overall ordinal model also supports this result (t = 4.12, p = 0.0000403 << 0.05).

## Group-wise analysis

I consider the overall model have already prove the claim. However, the analysis description asked me to notice how stability interact with group variable. So, based on two logistic model, we would conduct some group-wise analysis.

### Sources of Revelation & Blessed Virgin Mary(BVM)/Group-wise:
*Same as the first round, NRELREG2:NSTRUCTU is missing. I would ignore it and admit that is because of my lack of ability.*  
The analysis result suggests in the Rev. issue, the intercept of voting behavior possibility of bishops who live in a competitive or hostile religion environment is significant to the baseline group (national religion is RCC). (please forgive me for using such a direct inference) In other words, living in a competitive or hostile religion environment would make bishops would have a lower willingness to vote (-12.706252%, -12.444885%). However, their increasing/decreasing trends/slopes are not significant (z = -0.720 ~ 0.423, p = 0.471 ~ 0.966) in both model. So, we could not consider country religion as a general moderator in this analysis but only in the Rev. issue.

Eight participants did not report their marital status, and one participant did not report desired compensation, which led to a final sample size of N = 346. Students were asked their desired compensation in their first year after graduation. Desired compensation was coded as the midpoint of the chosen range, except for “under $75,000” (which was coded as $75,000) and “above $250,000” (coded as $250,000). Some respondents chose two or more consecutive answers. Their responses are coded as the midpoint of the full range. 

We tested the hypothesis that single female students, compared to non-single females, reported lower desired salaries when they expected their classmates to see their preferences. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a three-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA was chosen because the study had three factors (independent variables) and one dependent variable, and because the hypothesis included an interaction between the three factors (i.e., experimental condition, marital status, and gender). The Levene’s Test showed that the variances were equal, F(1, 338) = 1.64, p = .123. The 2 (condition: private vs. public) x 2 (marital status: single vs. non-single) x 2 (gender: female vs. male) ANOVA on desired compensation yielded no significant three-way interaction between condition, martial status, and gender, F(1, 338) = 2.28, p = .132, ¬ ηp2 = .007. 

We also calculated an alternative measure of desired compensation, where “under $75,000” was coded as $62,500 and “above $250,000” as $262,500 (as described in the original paper).

-	death/100k population was calculated from Total deaths variable and total population variable
-	state was extracted from stfips variable using the fips() function from cdlTools package

-	the data was filtered to only include data from years 1931 or later.

Hypothesis:
I tested the hypothesis (H1) that „there was a decline in the temperature-mortality relationship across decades”

Data analysis:
In broad strokes, my approach for testing the hypothesis was to build two mixed effect linear models to predict all-cause death per 100k population, one with the days with daily average temperature > 90°F in the past two month as the main predictor, and the other with the same predictor and its interaction with whether the year was 1960 or later. The p-value corresponding to the t-test of the coefficient of the interaction was used for main statistical inference. But model comparison was also used as an alternative hypothesis testing tool.

More specifically:
In model 1 the main fixed effect predictor of interest was the days with daily average temperature > 90°F in the past two month. Aside from the main predictor, there were also a set of control variables from the dataset to control for different relevant effects. I used the following control variables: 
-	""sh_0000"", ""sh_4564"", ""sh_6599"" – to control for the distribution of vulnerable populations in the states
-	""i1_statemove"" – to control for long term acclimatization to the local climate
Furthermore, I added two extra control variables, to control for seasonal and nonlinear trends in time from unknown sources:
-	A cubic spline of months with df = 4 was added, together with an interaction with year, to allow for seasonal changes in death rate within each year
-	A cubic spline of time with df = 9 was added to allow for cyclical or other nonlinear variations over decades, and to account for the effect of time
In addition, the random intercept of state was added as a random effect to the models, to account for different intercepts (mean death rate) across US states.

Model 2 was identical to model 1, aside from including the interaction of the main fixed effect predictor: days with daily average temperature > 90°F in the past two month with time as a simple linear effect.

Hypothesis testing:
The p-value corresponding to the t-test of the coefficient of the interaction was used for main statistical inference. If the p-value was lower than 0.05, and the coefficient was negative, I interpreted that as support for the alternative hypothesis listed above.
Furthermore, alternative hypothesis testing methods were also tested to check the robustness of the finding, since the p-value corresponding to the above mentioned t-test is not usiversally accepted as being accurate. The AIC was computed for both Model 1 and Model 2, and was compared. If the AIC was more than 2 points lower for Model 2 compared to Model 1, I checked for the sign of the estimate of the interaction term. If it was negative I concluded that the hypothesis was confirmed. Furthermore, anova was also used for model comparison.

Results:
My results indicated that there was a significant negative interaction between days with extreme hot temperature in the past two months and time (1931–59 vs. 1960–2004): estimate = -1.13, t-value = -23.92, p < 0.001.

However, the analysis specifications given by the Multi100 team for stage 2 were unreasonable (see details below).

Additional notes:
This is a research area which requires domain-specific knowledge because of the multitude of different confounders and their complex often nonlinear (cyclical, seasonal) effect over time. I do not have this domain specific knowledge, so that is why I marked 3 on my confident for the statistica approach.
Furthermore, I found the analysis specifications given by the Multi100 team for stage 2 unreasonable for several reasons:
1)	I was instructed to us a z-, t-, F-, or χ² test for testing the hypothesis, but there is no such test that would be universally accepted as accurate in the field for the mixed effect model that I though to be the best to test this hypothesis. The most accepted approaches are based on model fit comparison or bootstrapped confidence intervals.
2)	The tested claim did not specify which temperature extreme’s effect changed over the decades, I was nonetheless instructed to use 90+ F as a threshold for temperature extreme, so extreme temperature in the negative direction was ignored by this analysis.
3)	Similarly, the claim I had to test did not specify specific year periods, it simply says that there is a decline of the effect over the decades. Nevertheless, I was instructed to compare only 1931–59 vs. 1960–2004 periods. This largely oversimplifies the claim, and it also risks bias from cherry-picking these periods from a pool of possible time periods and other possible ways the effect of “decades” could be tested.
4)	I did not understand the reason for the instruction to “conduct your analysis without geographical, or precipitation frequency specification of the data”. These are important factors in determining the effect. It was similarly not justified, why I have to ignore socio-economic factors and technological and public health advancements over time, and cause of death in this stage 2 analysis.

Although initially the outcome variable was measured on a 1-4 Likert scale, it was subsequently converted into binary variable.

The study performs an information provision experiment whereby respondents were randomly informed on whether the local revenue is generated through taxes or windfalls. To find the effect of the tax treatment and to obtain the most interpretable estimates, I run a linear probability (OLS) model by regressing the outcome variable on the treatment variable.

Using the raw data provided by Andreoni et al., I calculated the dependent variable number of givers (“givers_tot” in my code) for each 23-minutes time interval for which the data were recorded.

Andreoni et al.’s field experiment relied on a 2x2 design varying the verbal ask (the focus of this analysis) as well as whether donations were solicited at one or both of the two main entry doors of the store at which the experiment was conducted. For my analysis, I created two treatment dummies for the two manipulations: one (“ask”) captures whether the ask was present (i.e., the variable is 0 when the ask was absent and 1 when it was present) and one (“both_doors”) captures whether donations were solicited at one or at both doors (i.e., the variable is 0 when donations were solicited at only one door and 1 when they were solicited at both doors). For the analysis in the second task, I was instructed to restrict the analysis “to the easy to avoid the fundraisers scenario”, i.e., the situation in which solicitors were present at only one door.

I was also asked to focus solely on the number of givers as a dependent variable (and not on the total amount of money donated). As this is a count variable, when asked to provide the results of a single statistical test, I choose to focus on the Poisson regression approach already applied in my analysis in Task 1. However, I think in general the right approach would be to consider the results across several different tests (e.g., in this case also OLS or t-tests or non-parametric tests such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) as done in my analysis for Task 1. Given the results of the analysis in Task 1, however, it is clear that the effect of the ask is highly robust and statistically significant in all kinds of tests.

Thus, for Task 2 I conducted a simple Poisson regression restricted to the observations when solicitors were present at only one door (i.e., the “both_doors” variable is equal to zero). I did not cluster the standard errors at the level of randomization (“blocks”), because that would have led to only 8 clusters, which is too few (and the “wild bootstrapping” procedure adjusting for the small number of clusters is not available for Poisson regressions in Stata).

As the outcome variable is binary, I use probit: WTPdummy_i = a + b*treatment_i + c*X’+ e_i, where b is the coefficient of interest, treatment_i are treatment dummies, and X’ is the vector of control variables. As the treatment is randomized at the individual level, I do not cluster standard errors as my inference focusses on the sample, not a broader population. To confirm the original claim, this coefficient should be negative and statistically significantly different from zero.
The instructions regarding the control variables to include were mostly clear, but in a few aspects ambiguous: 
•	“Household income” appears to refer to _family_ income including bolsa, and could be in logs or levels. 
•	Discount factors could relate to the ones estimated based on now vs 1 week or 1 week vs 2 weeks. 
•	 “Religion, dummies” should refer religion dummies, but it was unclear whether they should be included only for parents or for both parents and children. 
•	Number of children in household: this information does not exist. There is a question regarding number of children (but this may include children not living in the household).
To account for this ambiguity, I create two vectors of control variables. In the preferred vector, I include family income in logs and the discount factor estimates based on 1 week vs 2 weeks.  Further, I include religion dummies for both parents and children. In the alternative vector, I use family income in levels, delta estimates based on now vs 1 week, and no religion dummies for children.

The independent variable, instead, following the paper’s original claim was defined as a summated standardized index, meant to capture the neighborhood poverty levels associated to each individual responses.

A combination of regression analyses was employed to account for the variegated nature of the available data. More specifically, to build on the approximately continuous nature of the dependent variable of interest, a first set of OLS regression model specification was employed. Subsequently, in order to, in primis, account for the violation of some of the (strong) assumptions that OLS entails, and, in secundis, properly consider the ordinal but finite nature of the dependent variable as previously defined, an ordered logistic regression was used.

As the direction of this difference was not based on an a priori hypothesis, I chose to focus on a less specified hypothesis, namely that cooperation rates differ between the short-stochastic and short-deterministic condition. In the study, each of 24 participants within a session was paired with each of the remaining 23 participants to play 23 Prisoner's dilemma supergames. As cooperation rates likely depend on both players, a model with crossed random effects for participants and their partners seems suitable. The main variable of interest is the cooperation rate, determined as the proportion of time within a supergame that a participant chose the cooperation action. This variable is bounded between 0 and 1, but has many observations on these bounds, which poses problems for linear models. An appropriate model for such data is a zero-one-inflated Beta regression model. However, the results of such a model will not allow for using a single ""standard"" (e.g. t or F) statistic, which was required for Task 2.

In Task 1 I tested the claim that ""On indirect measures focusing on positive valence, members of non-dominant racial groups showed ingroup favoritism"".
Based on the original article, the non-dominant racial groups are: Asian, Black, Hispanic. In principle, in order to fully test the claim I tested all different groups against the White group. We also focused on Study 1 as we had the data for only this study.  For all analyses, I selected only the data of participants that are US residents.

The analyses first included the reproduction of the main results as those were reported on Tables 1 and 2 of the main paper. Table 1 reports the results of independent samples t-test for differences between good-focal and bad-focal MC-IATs. Table 2 reports the results of each MC-IAT using one sample t-test with zero as the comparison value. For the latest scores, the aggregated values as well as the reduced values as those computed following the Nosek et al. (2014) guidelines.  Please note that for the full reproduction I needed to apply selection criteria (e.g., remove too fast responses) but this was not done for the main analyses.

Then, I repeated the same analyses as in the orignal paper but within a Bayesian framework. I did that by computing Bayes factors for independent samples t-test using the BayesFactor package (Morey et al., 2015) in R. As the sample size was too large, I decided to use the ultrawide
 r scale for the prior distribution of the alternative hypothesis, meaning that I will be needing more evidence for a larger Bayes factor. Please note that changing the r scale factor for the prior
 distribution of the alternative hypothesis did not change the direction of the results.
 
For reaching my conclusions I decided to only use and combine the results of Table 1 as this seemed the most appropriate. The mean of the Bayes Factors was 3.929803e+131 with a standard deviation of 9.626013e+131.
These results provide conclusive evidence towards confirmation of the research hypothesis.

For Task 2, the same analyses were performed but now focused only in the Black group (N = 1676) and only running an independent sample t-test between the good and bad focal group. The resulting Bayes factor was 1010753000000000. This provides conclusive evidence for our hypothesis. In other words, we can conclude that ""On indirect measures focusing on positive valence, members of a black racial groups showed ingroup favoritism"".

ANALYSIS 1
RDD estimation of the base+2 effect as a regression coefficient in a neighborhood of the discontinuity with triangular weights; validation through varying bandwidth and bootstrap

We estimate the base+2 effect as a regression coefficient in a neighborhood of the discontinuity with triangular weights and a bandwidth equal to 50 (i.e. the whole range of the vote variable). We introduce all the variables considered in Table 1, panel A, line 2 in Clark (2009). The kernel allows us to weight differently the observations that are near the discontinuity and those that are not. Note that this is not a classical GLS/FGLS estimator as the weights are not related to the variance or to the sampling probability but measure the relevance of the observation. (See the Appendix of the report for the derivation of the formulas.)

For the computation of the p-value we use a two-tailed test based on the normal approximation. While the one-tailed test would have been more correct, we prefer the two-tailed test to reduce the impact of choices favoring the alternative hypothesis over the null.

We perform two robustness checks, one concerning the bandwidth and one concerning the normal approximation and the variance.

We first show what happens when the bandwidth varies. The solid thick line represents the estimates, the dashed thin line the two-sided confidence intervals at 95%, the solid thin line the one-sided confidence intervals at 95%. The estimates are rather stable but the confidence intervals are large. For this reason we chose the largest possible bandwidth. 

At last we use the bootstrap to check that our computations of the variance are correct. Indeed the empirical cdf based on the bootstrapped values (in black) is very near to the normal cdf using our computations (in red).",z-statistic,3.038,726,none,p-value,0.002379086,"CONCLUSIONS

For my test of the hypothesis selected from the original paper, I then followed these steps:

1. Descriptive analyses of the data. This included checking number of participants per experimental condition, and reproducing “Figure 1” from the paper, i.e. the main descriptive results (the influence of the experimental treatments on the outcome variable).

2. Test of the hypothesis. The result I was assigned to reproduce concerned the influence of two experimental treatments, each with two “levels”, on a binary outcome variable. Specifically, the claim of the original paper related to an effect occurring at one level of one of the predictors, namely: “In the active-frame condition, utilitarian responding was more likely in positive moods than in negative moods (p. 374)”.

To produce a single, main result, I choose (for Task 2) to run a logistic regression analysis predicting the outcome variable (“decision”) from the binary experimental treatment variable “mood”, using only participants from the “active” level of the second experimental treatment (as this was the level of that variable referred to in the hypothesis). The analysis was the same as my main/final one in Task 1, with the difference that I in the previous run conducted additional tests before (and after) arriving at this one. I made no additions to my original analyses. 

The result was therefore the same as in my previous analysis: that for participants in the Active frame condition, “Decision” was significantly predicted by the “Mood” experimental condition, such that an increase in positive mood was associated with an increased propensity to make the utilitarian choice (to push) in the dilemma of the experimental task, z = 3.304, p <. 001.",z-statistic,3.304,200,1,p-value,0.000952,"The analysis showed that for participants in the Active frame condition, “Decision” was significantly predicted by the “Mood” experimental condition, such that an increase in positive mood was associated with an increased propensity to make the utilitarian choice (to push) in the dilemma of the experimental task.",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",4,243

           The key hypothesis of the current study is to test the potential link between the degree of risk aversion and the decision error. To measure the degree of risk attitude for each subject, I used the average number of safe choices from the price list format of Probability Variation (PV) and Reward Variation (RV) as an index to represent the magnitude of risk attitude. To calibrate decision error, I define the frequency of choice of the large mean spread option as the error, that is, the incidence of the choice of the left option for the first 4 choices and the selection of the right option for the last 5 choices in the LV. The dependent variable is decision error and average number of safe choices is the independent variable. To manifest the connection of risk aversion with decision error, I only involve the subjects who have average 5 or larger times of safe choice selection out of the total 10, which results in 79 out of total 106 subjects for final analysis. As both the dependent and independent variables are continuous, I run the standard linear regression for statistical test. Following the routine practice, I make use of the t-statistics from the regression model to get the p value for the interested regressor (i.e., Average Number of Safe Choices here). To further validate the robustness of the findings, I also run the regression with robust standard error, see regression table in html output for details. 
          The regression suggests that there is a negative link between average number of safe choice and decision error (β=-0.086, t = -4.577, p < 0.001), which suggests that, the higher the degree of risk aversion, the lower the frequency of decision error. The regression with robust standard error further confirms such a finding (β=-0.086, t = - 4.648, p < 0.001).",t-statistic,-4.577,79,77,p-value,0.0000178,"It indicates that, the higher the Average Number of Safe Choices, the less the Error rate in the price list, replicating the original finding of the study.",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,Yes,30,244

Thus, risk aversion was operationalized by the number  of choosing the safe over the risky option in the RV and PV tasks. Therefore, the number of times choosing the safe option was summed up for each task before calculating the arithmetic mean of safe choices across both tasks. This mean was used to divide the sample in risk averse participants with more than five safe choices on average in each task and risk seeking participants with five or fewer safe choices. Decision errors were operationalized as violations of stochastic dominance in the LV task. As all options in that task have the same expected value, dominance is defined (as in the original paper) as “the asset with the lower potential return but greater chance of success”, that is, by a higher chance of receiving an outcome even if this outcome has a lower magnitude than the alternative. Thus, each response can be categorized as a violation of stochastic dominance (i.e., a decision error) or no violation (except for item 5, in which both options are identical, which is why this item is excluded from the score of decision errors). The number of violations was summed up over all nine eligible items. To satisfy the additional constraint of not using rank order tests, a Pearson correlation between the average number of safe choices in PV and RV tasks and the number of decision errors in the LV task was calculated.

This data has a continuous IV (median age) and continuous DV (rate of new business formation). So we require a continuous by continuous association measure. The author was instructed NOT to use Pearson’s r, but instead z-, t-, F-, and chi square.  These CANNOT summarise a continuous-by-continuous relationship (although they can test hypotheses about the distribution of a parameters from regression models). These statistics require at least one variable to be a small number of discrete groups. To apply these statistics it would be necessary to censor the data, for example, by cutting the median age variable into “high” and “low” then conducting a t-test comparing the rate of entrepreneurship between “high and low” aged countries. Censoring the data like this does not change the relationship between variables, it simply reduces the power of the test and potentially distorts the effect size.

In my original analysis I took the median age and business formation rate for all available countries.

To test the claim whether a larger median age is associated with less entrepreneurship in a country, I use the existing median age variable medage_20_64 as dependent variable. The key explanatory variable, a measure of the share of entrepreneurship in the population, is entre_wage. I use the full sample (that is, all countries and all years).

Since countries differ in many unobservable respects, I use country fixed effects to control for unobserved, time-invariant differences between countries. Moreover, I use year fixed effects to control for global time specific effects. The resulting fixed effects regression therefore estimates the relationship of entrepreneurship and median age based on variation over time within the same country, after controlling for global year effects. 

Since the entrepreneurship variable is obtained based on surveys with varying sample sizes across country and years, I weight the country-year observations by those survey sample sizes. Finally, the standard errors are heteroscedasticity robust and clustered on country level, since variables are highly correlated within country. The resulting linear regression estimates for country c in year y:

entre_wage _{cy}=a_{c}+b*medage_20_64_{cy}+c*YearFE+e_{cy},

where YearFE is a set of dummy variables for each year in the sample and c is the associated coefficient vector, a_{c} is the country specific intercept (country fixed effect), e_{cy} is the error term. b is the coefficient of interest, the null hypothesis is b=0.

Steps to fulfil instructions of task 2: This is the exact same regression as in task 1, because the instructions for task 2 are all fulfilled by this regression. In particular, the outcome variable is median age and nor r, no controls except country and year fixed effects are used, and all countries are used (not just OECD countries).

ICCs revealed that there is no variance of the difference variables attributable to the individual-level but only notable variance attributable to the household-level.

However, in the first task (what I considered a replication task), I based my analysis on a two-way fixed effects approach, exploiting the panel dimension of the data. There are two key advantages using this approach:
- country fixed effects absorb all time-invariant variation of a country, i.e. geographic location, islands vs mainland, no. of bordering countries, culture, norms, colonization experience, etc.
- year fixed effects absorb all variation common to all countries, e.g. the overall trend in granting voting rights to citizens living abroad
	 
In task 2, however, I need to change the approach to accomodate the control variables the Multi100 project team like to see included. More precisely, I need to alter my approach as the Mutli100 project team asked me to *not* include geographic information on previously communist countries, which I would automatically control for when including country fixed effects.

Therefore, I employ the following estimation model w/o country fixed effects:

2022-07-22T23:53:12Z,EPK9W,Kleven_AmEcoRev_2013_Jg9v,Stata,"I include data from 1983 onwards, as that is the period from which the data is complete. Like the original authors, I exclude Greece due to the removal of the payroll tax for new players between 1993 and 2003. I analyze the evolution of top players as a share of all players, as in the original paper. 

The share of top players may evolve over time due to many factors, thus there is a need for a comparison group. Because of the low number of units (countries) with available data, I chose to analyze the research question with the synthetic control method (SCM). The SCM provides a data-driven way to construct a comparison group. The SCM matches the actual Denmark and the pool of control countries on several pre-treatment variables in order to construct a counterfactual “synthetic” Denmark based on a convex combination of other countries. The synthetic Denmark may serve as a counterfactual Denmark without the tax reform. Importantly, the SCM provides a way to perform inference even when data is available only for a few units and large-sample inference is not applicable. This follows the logic of permutation test, where the treatment is systematically allocated to all units, and one investigates whether the estimated effects are large relatively to the (placebo) effects for other units. 

When applying the SCM, I match on pre-treatment average values of the outcome, the quality of the foreign players and two measures of the quality of the league – “Total points earned by all clubs in a given country*year in all European competitions” and “Average UEFA team coefficient in the country”. 

When analyzing top players (players who have played for their national team) as a share of foreigners, the results suggest an increase after the reform. It should be noted that this is a quite crude measure of the ability of foreign players. There is only data available on 14 countries, one of which (Greece) is excluded. Of these 13, Denmark has the 9th largest break in the fit after 1991 (post- versus pre-treatment MPSE) when analyzing effects on top players as a share of all players, implying a permutation-test-based p-value of 8/13 ≈ 0.615 (the chance of picking a country with a ratio of at least that size if picking a country at random). 

An additional challenge with the low number of countries is that a few comparison countries may drive the results. This is indeed the case here, as Sweden always gets a very large weight, sometimes even to the exclusion of all other countries, i.e. the comparison is only against Sweden. When Sweden is excluded, Norway typically gets most or all of the weight. Thus the evaluation is essentially a comparison of the evolution of the top ability share of players in Denmark versus in Sweden or Norway. That does not invalidate the results, but implies that a thorough investigation of whether there may have been relevant concurrent developments in these countries is necessary. It should be noted that Sweden and Norway are neighboring countries of Denmark and may have been affected by the policy change in Denmark, something that further increases the uncertainty of the results.","Permutation-test as suggested in Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller (2015) of the question of whether or not the estimated effect of the reform is large relative to the distribution of placebo effects.",13.121 (Root mean squared error prediction rate),338,Not applicable.,p-value,0.615,"The results are consistent with both no change in the ability composition of foreigners and a changed ability composition in favor of higher-ability players, however, the post-reform developments were not unlike those in most other countries.",Same as claimed by the original study,No,Yes,13,294

In the present analyses, psychological well-being was modelled as a latent factor with 8 indicators. Because two items (wrhpp_r, enjlf_r) were worded in the positive direction as compared to the remaining items, correlated uniquenesses were specified for these items. The latent factor was identified by constraining the factor loading of item fltdpr_r to 1 and the mean of the latent factor to 0. The items were modeled as ordered indicators using a probit link function. To account for the clustered data structure with respondents being nested within countries, a multilevel factor model was specified. Then, latent well-being was regressed on two dummy-coded variables indicating whether a respondent currently lived with children (coded 1) or lived alone after children moved out (coded 1) as compared to not having any children at all (coded 0). The cluster structure was acknowledged by specifying a random slope for these indicators. Then, the z-standardized childlessness norm indicator was included as a cross-level moderator for both dummy-indicators. All models included several control variables to reduce confounding bias. These analyses were carried out in Mplus 8.5 with a Bayesian estimator using 4 chains and a thinning of 20. Convergence was assessed using the potential scale reduction (PSR) criterion by Gelman and Rubin (1992). Values less than 1.05 indicated reasonable convergence. Significance was evaluated using a two-sided p-value based on the posteriori distribution of the interaction terms.
These analysis strategy was adopted because well-being represents a latent construct and, thus, should be treated as such in empirical analyses to account for measurement error. The mixed-effects specifications used in these analyses acknowledges the clustered data structure and, thus, allows estimating country-level effects on individual-level outcomes.

Missing data was present above 3% in 6 predictor variables in the reproduced dataset.

Given that father’s education (6.7% missing values) was not included in the current analysis (was included in Task 1), father on birth certificate (3.57% missing values) was imputed instead, as it complied with both the above 3% missingness criterion and the 3-variable imputation, as in the original article.
The hypothesis was that discrepant responses between parents about who their child lived with, based on reports about household rosters, would be more likely for fathers who reported spending nights with the mother, relative to fathers who reported not spending nights with either mother or child. This hypothesis was tested using the same approach as in the original model, via a multiple logistic regression model. 
A binary logistic regression model was run to test if discrepancy in parent reports of focal child living in their household roster was more likely when fathers reported spending nights with the mother, with other explanatory variables held constant (fathers reporting spending nights with child only, the relationship between the parents, parents reporting living together at previous wave) and controlling for variables indicated in Task 2 (i.e., Traditional gender views, mother; Traditional gender views, father; Time between interviews (months); Visitation agreement; Child support order; Father’s distance from mother; Father visited hospital; Father’s name on birth certificate; Father gave money during pregnancy; Father suggested abortion; Mother experienced abuse; Father has substance use problem; Father in jail). The model was run in one step (with all variables entered at once), on both imputed datasets (and results were pooled) and a dataset in which missing values were removed (for the latter model results, see Analysis Code). This approach was chosen to provide the most conservative tests for the focal claim in the original article. 
The pooled result from the imputed datasets showed that discrepancy was 3.09 times more likely if father reported spending nights with mother relative to spending no nights with either mother or child, controlling for nights spent with child-only and other potential factors that could influence discrepant responses, B = 1.13, robust SE = 0.47, p = .017.",Wald-statistic,2.381,1149,1,p-value,.017,"The claim that parent discrepant responses about who their child lives with, extracted from each parent’s report of who lives in their household roster, are higher for fathers who reported spending nights with mothers, relative to those that didn’t, was supported by the current reproduced analysis.",Same as claimed by the original study,No,Yes,15,313
2022-07-29T13:01:59Z,OPNR7,Sliwka_JournLabEco_2017_VDJV,R,"rocedure: First, I am loading the original data provided in OSF into R, using ""haven"", as the original data comes from Stata. As the dataset includes also data that does not stem from the main experiment, I select data according to the main experiment. The research question (""Claim"") is the following: A profile that continuously increases wages by small amounts raises performance relative to a constant wage (p.299, abstract in original article). In the additional task instructions of task 2, I am restricted to reporting one test, which is the first test I reported in task 1.

First, I want to make analytical decisions about how can the variables be operationalized? The independent variable is relatively straight forward: The treatment ""continuous"" has to be compared against the ""baseline"". The dependent variable presents more researcher degrees of freedom: It is plausible to use the ""overall performance"" (i.e., sum over eight rounds), or the ""raw data"" (i.e., value in each round). In addition, one could consider ""log-transformed"" data, as the original paper did). I argue that the choice of most straightforward analytical protocol is: Performance must refer to the total output generated, so the treatment would have to produce a positive effect on total performance (output over all rounds). After all, the principal would be interested in the total output, rather than when the output is generated. Thus, I am focusing on total performance.

This claim can then be tested using an ANOVA, reporting post-hoc comparisons of means (the planned contrast between baseline and continuous treatment needs to show a significant difference). The ANOVA and post-hoc test evaluate the treatment effect. The difference between treatments is 3.79 (95%CI: -4.45 - 12.04), but the effect is not significant, as reported in the other survey question. The adjusted p-value (TukeyHSD) is 0.6535, thereby not showing an effect. Holm and Bonferroni also produce non-significant results, with higher p-values. My initial conclusion is therefore: The claim cannot be supported by the data, using the reasoning and quantitative strategy outlined above.",F-statistic,0.552,211,3; 207,p-value,0.647,"The claim is not supported, the proposed effect is not supported by the data",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",6,314
2022-07-29T14:26:15Z,HHSLN,Bursztyn_JournPoliEco_2012_jaK4,R,"A better formated version of this can be found in the OSF repository: I was tasked to reanalyze an aspect of (Bursztyn & Coffman, 2012). Specifically, I was asked to investigate whether the following claim is true:

“Armed with this monitoring technology [text-messages] ... the proportion [of parents] willing to pay to keep the conditionality drops ... compared to the baseline treatment. (p. 362.)”

Methods

Experimental Setup & Data Set

The full description of the data set can be found in Bursztyn & Coffman (2012).

Brazilian parents were asked whether they wanted to keep the condition cash transfer of R$120 (conditional on their children attending school 85 percent of the days of that month)   or switch to an unconditional cash transfer. The amount for the unconditional transfer started at R$120 and was raised in increments of R$5 to R$180. The parent had to choose between conditional and unconditional options for each amount. 5 percent of participants had one of their decisions implemented. That decision was randomly chosen from the questions.

Parents were randomly assigned to multiple treatment groups. The claim concerns only two treatment groups: The baseline group and the text-message treatment group. For the baseline group, the conditional condition is the same as the one with which the parents came to the experiment. For the text-message treatment group, the parents were offered to receive a free text message sent to their cell phone every day their child misses class before having to choose between conditional and unconditional payments. Only the two parents that did not have a cell phone did not accept the offer, and those were excluded from the analysis.

For this research question, the variable willing to pay was most important. This is a dummy variable that is equal to one if the parent prefers a R$120 conditional crash transfer to an unconditional cash transfer that pays strictly more (that is > R$120), and zero otherwise. 

Statistical Analysis

Described in statistical terms, the claim essentially states that the binary variable treatment and the binary willing to pay are positively related.

I conducted a logistic regression analysis. Besides using a dummy variable encoding the treatment group, I also used the following covariates as predictors: household income, employed parent dummy, employed parent’s spouse dummy, age (parent and child), male dummy (parent and child), higher show-up fee dummy, weekly discount factor (parent and child), time inconsistency discount factor [beta] (for parent and child), marital status (parent), religion, dummies, number of children in the household, household is earning CCTs for more than one child, race dummies (parent and child), years of schooling (parent and child).

Assumptions

I checked the assumptions of both methods (see analysis file). No evidence for a strong violation was found.

Results


Logistic Regression

Logistic regression found evidence for a relationship between willing to pay and treatment group, after controlling for the covariates, z=3.77,p<.001. The corresponding 95% confidence interval suggests that given covariates being held constant, the odds of choosing the conditional payment are between 21.43 and  6496.27 higher in the baseline compared to the treatment group. Thus, while we can say that there is a stronger preference for conditional payment in the baseline group, the exact size of this effect is still rather uncertain.


Conclusion:

The original claim is correct : Armed with this monitoring technology [text-messages] ... the proportion [of parents] willing to pay to keep the conditionality drops ... compared to the baseline treatment. (p. 362.). However, more data is needed to be sure how strong this effect is.

Given that this question considers differences between groups, an analysis of variance was conducted. Given that the groups are naturally occurring, there might be systematic differences between subjects that are related to their work absorption, but not to their family structure. Hence, to get a “purer” measure of the relation between work absorption and family structure, age, gender and job position were included as covariates as in the original paper. A one-way ANCOVA was performed using SPSS 24.
Unemployed and retired respondents were filters out from the sample because they could not answer questions about their current work absorption.
The independent variable consisted of family structure (1 = single childless; 0 = other structure), the covariates were age, gender, and job level. Method 1 to adjust for unequal sample size was used because it is more conservative (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). After adjustment by covariates, work absorption varied significantly with family structure, F (1, 348) = 5.58, p = .02, the strength of the association is weak: µ2 = .02. Pairwise comparison between adjusted marginal means shows that single childless workers have lower absorption than workers with other family structures, Δ = -.31, SE = .13, p = .02, 95% CI [-.57, -.05], Cohen's d = .05. No covariate was significantly associated with work absorption.

Ordinal regression (with a probit link function) was conducted to test how participant support (rated on a scale from 1, ‘no support at all’, to 7, ‘complete support) varied based on the potential impact of the FDI project on the local labor market (3 levels: no impact on local job market, may create 1000 local jobs, may have negative impact on local job market). Specifically, given the requested focus on the positive impact on the local job market, the hypothesis that support did not significantly differ between ‘may create 1000 local jobs’ and the average of the other two levels was tested (vs. comparing all the levels in Task 1). This statistical technique was chosen as the dependent variable was an ordinal variable (i.e., inherent order to the levels of the support rating) and hence an ordinal regression is best suited to test the claim. 

Results showed that participants gave significantly more support to FDI projects that may have a positive impact on the local job market (mean rating = 5.30) compared to the support for those projects that have no or negative impact (mean rating = 4.74; z-statistic = 29.2, p < 0.001).

For the overall model specification, it was debated whether or not to include other attributes investigated in the study (i.e., home country of FDI, industry, entry mode, amount of investment, policy concessions, and wage level). However, given the claim is specific to a single attribute, the decision was made to only include that attribute in the model.

I then loaded the .csv file into R and cleaned the data. In the cleaning phase, I removed three empty lines (located at the end of the file) as well as one empty column. I noticed that the age column contained one missing observation (it was marked as dot (.)), so I set it to the age average. Finally, I made some R related adjustments for the analysis (i.e., factorizing the condition and gender columns).
Data scrutinizing: Before starting the analysis, I scrutinized the data and tried to make sense of the provided field considering the description of the study in the paper. I then detected that the column Subject which seems to represent subject ids contained the following 13 duplicated ids: mkt2-5, mkt4-3, mkt5-7, mkt7-4, mkt9-2, mkt3-4, mkt9-6, mkt2-4, mkt8-4, mkt1-3, mkt2-8, mkt4-4, mkt7-3. I therefore created two additional datasets that excluded duplicated subjects. Since it was not clear weather the first or the second observation of each duplicated subject should be counted, I created one dataset for each alternative. I therefore ended the pre-analysis stage with three datasets: The original dataset provided to me (with 102 obs.), and two datasets (with 89 obs. in each) which excluded duplicated subjects. 
Analysis: I first observed the number of subjects in each condition and summary statistics for the variables of interest. These observations confirmed subjects were randomly assigned to conditions (in term of observable factors like gender and age) and that the cells were relatively balanced. It also suggested that those in the treatment condition (disrupted video) indicated higher preference and WTP compared to those in the control condition.  
Statistical test:
Because the second task requested “a single main result” and the claim to be analyzed (from the instruction of the first task) was that “commercial disruption made the program more enjoyable,” in the second task I only test the enjoyable measure, but not the WTP measure. In addition, the current analysis uses linear regression as a single test to allow controlling for demographics. Since the analysis of the first task revealed that gender significantly influences reported enjoyment, controlling for gender in the analysis would allow testing whether the effect of disruption on enjoyment exists irrespective of other observable factors influencing enjoyment. Finally, as mentioned above, the provided dataset may include duplicated participants. While the single analysis reported here includes all observations as if no duplication exists, additional analyses not reported here (but included in the attached analyses file) confirmed that the result remains the same when adjusting for this possibility.
A single main result: A linear regression of the relative preference, predicted by the condition (control vs. treatment), and controlled by gender and age confirmed that commercial disruption made the program more enjoyable (B = .97, t(98) = 2.63, p = .001).

2022-08-02T12:57:20Z,6U3LL,Usmani_AmJournSocio_2018_GJe4,R,"The one additional analysis (required in Task 2) is based on a within-between (linear mixed effects model with within-between specification) panel regression model with 5-year lagged predictor variables. The main aim is to test the effect of disruptive capacity on the level of democracy. The level of democracy is operationalized with V-Dem Electoral democracy score as stated in the description of Task 2. 

Within-between regression model combines the advantages of modeling “fixed effects” with “random effects” which allows for the inclusion of time-invariant coefficients. Time-dependent predictor variables are: lagged version of the dependent variable, lagged regional average of the dependent variable for a specific country as well as ""true"" independent variables with a 5-year lag: the log of GDP per capita, GDP growth rate, the disruptive capacity of nonelites, educational attainment in years, level of urbanity, landlord power, and income inequality (Gini). Time-invariant predictors are (as in the original analysis) a fixed effect of year and country. Besides that, we have a random intercept given for each country. Given the aim of the original research, the methods and statistical procedures used in the analysis are a good fit, and in my opinion, there was no need for including additional variables in the analysis given the coverage of the ones originally employed in the model. 

A single model was built and estimated in R using 'panelr' package. Due to the possibility of Nickell's bias where we would have a correlation of order 1/T between explanatory variables and error term (where T is the length of the panel) we use the sample of the data where we have at least 5 years of complete observations for each sampled country, reducing the bias-inducing correlation at expense of sample size (829) and country variability.

The model had 61 cross-sectional observational units (countries) dating from 1907 to 2007. We look at withing effects of the 5-year lagged version of the disruptive capacity of the nonelites variable.

This analysis tested if the more differently valued the issues over which states are bargaining, the more likely they are to offer concessions (H1 of original paper), using GDP as a control variable. To test this prediction, I computed a multilevel logit regression with random slopes, nested within country and nested within bargaining event, using the lme4 and lmerTest packages in R. I chose this model because the data was non-independent (based on country and bargaining event) and the dependent measure was ordinal with 4 levels. 

Cooperative strategy (coded 0 to 3 by original author) was the dependent variable, where higher numbers indicate more cooperative bargaining strategies. I also included how important it was for the country to reach an agreement as a covariate and the natural log of GDP as a control. The overall model predicted cooperative strategy (Overall model: AIC = 193.3, BIC = 219.6, Pseudo-R2 = 0.76), and that the odds of states using cooperative strategies increased with greater issue salience (Marginal effect = 0.06, z = 3.14, p = .002).

Additionally, my analysis from Task 1 included GDP (natural log) as a control, along with more control variables, which included importance of reaching an agreement, publicity, type of foreign policy, and the presidency of the EU.

158 Serbs in three separate regions of Kosovo were recruited.

MEASURES:
Outgroup Bridging Norms. Outgroup bridging norms were measured by the amount of euros respondents gave to a hypothetical Albanian target in a dictator game. Respondents could give anywhere from €0 to €5 (in €0.50 increments).

Outgroup Exposure. Exposure to outgroup members in the dataset was proxied by region. In the original dataset, these were labeled as the ""predominantly Albanian Region,"" (the Graˇcanica region) in So the ""Border Region,"" (northern Mitrovica) and the ""Predominantly Serb Region"" (Zubin Potok, Zveˇcan, Leposavi ́c,and Leˇsak). The region variable was transformed to reflect the percentage of Albanians (outgroup) in the region according to the most recent Kosovo Census estimate (23.18%, 7.03%, and 4.10%, respectively).

ANALYTIC STRATEGY
To test the claim that outgroup bridging norms increase with outgroup exposure, I employ a bivariate ordinary least squares regression with outgroup bridging as the outcome and outgroup exposure as the predictor.

My independent attempt to validate the claim of interest--""the disruptive capacity of non-elites drives democratic gains"" (664)--from [Usmani 2018](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/700235) differs from the original approach in two ways:

1. Sample selection.  Like [Usmani 2018](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/700235), I evaluated the claim using two different measures of democracy.  However, I further restricted the sample to only those country-years with non-missing observations for *both* democracy indicators.  This helps ensure that the observed results were robust to the choice of democracy indicator alone, as opposed to the choice of democracy indicator *in the context of* the relevant sample set available for each indicator.
2. Regression on contemporaneous independent variables.  [Usmani 2018](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/700235) specification regressed democracy on a one-period lag of *all* independent variables ($X_{t-1}$), including the one-period lag of the dependent variable ($Y_{t-1}$).  The decision to use $X_{t-1}$ seemed redundant, since those effects are already present and captured by $Y_{t-1}$.  As such, with the obvious exception of $Y_{t-1}$I used contemporaneously measured independent variables on the RHS of the equation.

## Results

Despite this differences, I obtain substantively similar results when estimating the long-run effects of both measures of democracy..  The long-run effects of disruptive capacity are positively associated with the level of democracy, statistically significant at a level of p<0.005

2022-08-02T15:58:13Z,9FO7L,Chen_Demography_2018_yAPR,R,"The first step was to download the relevant datasets. The original article used LISS panel data, available from https://www.dataarchive.lissdata.nl/. The data used in the original paper were the LISS panel data available prior to July 2015. The LISS panel data is still being collected today in 2022. For this analysis, only the data which would have been available to the authors were used, meaning waves 1 to 6 of the available 14 waves. The available and relevant datasets were the ""personality"" and ""background data"" datasets. The original article also used the ""health"" datasets which contained variables relating to, for example, alcohol consumption and smoking habits in the previous seven days. For this analysis, the health datasets were not deemed relevant as the data was collected approximately 6 months after the data on the focal dependent variable ""happiness"", and health conditions could vary substantially in those 6 months.

The personality data was collected annually over the six waves. In each wave of data collection, participants responded across two months. For example, in wave 1 a percentage of responses were collected in May, and the remaining responses were collected in August of 2008. The first stage of data cleaning was to remove all irrelevant variables, keeping only the happiness DV variable and the participant ID, and to divide the data from the 6 waves into 12 data frames based on the date and year of data collection. The happiness variable was measured on by a Likert-type item on a scale from 0-10 (10 being the most positive response a participant could give).

The background data was collected each month. Each participant in the LISS panel responded to the full background data questionnaire on a monthly basis. Only the relevant background data was downloaded, to correspond to the personality data frames. For example, in Wave 1 (year = 2008) as the personality data had some participants respond in May and others in August, the May 2008 and August 2008 background data was downloaded. This was repeated for each of the 6 included waves of data, giving 12 background data data frames. For each of these, all but the variables which were deemed relevant were removed. The remaining variables included those pertaining to participant ID, participant house ID, date of survey collection, participant gender, participant position in the household (household head, a family member, a child of the household head, etc.), participant age, number of children living in the house, whether the participant was living with their partner or not, the participants civil status, the participants domestic situation, the dwelling type (e.g. owned, rented, etc.), participant annual income, and participants highest level of education qualification.

The focal hypothesis for Task 1 was to determine whether married couples who lived together were statistically more or less happy than unmarried couples who lived together, i.e. testing weather ""married"" couples were more or less happy than ""cohabiting"" couples. Therefore, all data from participants who were not either the household head or their married/unmarried partner were removed from the background data data frames. This step resulted in some errors in data entry becoming apparent, for example one participant was listed both as a household head's child and their partner. The data were cleaned to remove any participants with conflicting information. Next, each participants sexual orientation was determined in the same way as it was in the original article. As the datasets now only contained information on couples living within the same household, if the genders of both people in a couple were the same, both people were classified as homosexual. If their genders differed they were both classified as heterosexual.

The final stage in data preparation was to merge the datasets. First the personality and background data frames were merged based on each month, using the participant ID to join the datasets. This resulted in 12 data frames in total. Next, the data frames were joined based on the wave of personality data collection which was annual. In other words, the May 2008 and August 2008 dataframes were merged to give a data frame for all participants data from 2008. This was repeated for each wave, giving data frames from 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. At this stage, a new variable was created in each data frame to indicate the year of data collection as until now the ""wave variable"" contain information on both year and month of data collection. Finally, all annual/wave data frames were merged into a single dataset to test the hypothesis with.

A linear mixed model was run using the lme4 r package. In it, happiness was the DV, and simple effects and an interaction effect of time (year) and relationship status were included, as well as fixed effects of age, income, number of children, gender, highest level of educational attainment, sexual orientation, and dwelling type. Random effect of individuals within different relationship status were allowed. An ANOVA table was used to see the effect of relationship status on happiness and the included p-value was interpreted to see whether relationship status had a significant effect or not. The result was significant, F(1, 2290.8) = 44.8074, p < .001, indicating that relationship status did have an effect on happiness. Estimated marginal means were computed using the emmeans r package to see whether married or cohabiting people reported being happier, and the result indicate that married people (M = 7.81, SE = 0.0925) were significantly happier than cohabiting people (M = 7.57, SE = 0.0944).

For Task 2, the task was to test the same hypothesis but with female participants only. The same dataset was used, except data from any male participants was first removed (there were only male and female participants left after the previously described data cleaning process). The resulted in a female only dataset. A linear mixed model was again specified using the exact same parameters as before, except the fixed effect gender variate was not included. Again, the ANOVA table was examined and a significant effect of relationship status was observed, F(1, 1135.9) = 21.3125, p < 0.001. Estimated marginal means indicated that married females (M = 7.84, SE = 0.126) were significantly happier than cohabiting females (M = 7.62, SE = 0.128).",F-statistic,21.313,3646,1;1135.9,p-value,0.000004346,Married females report significantly higher levels of happiness than cohabiting females.,Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,Yes,30,340

The predictor variable that indicates if neighboring countries have decided to give their expatriate citizen the vote is k6delta. I included the following control variables in the model: having been in the British/French/Spanish empire, having English legal heritage, GDP, population, and years since regime change (respectively colbrit, colfren, colspan, legengl, lngdp, lnpop, lndur). 

I excluded backsliding countries from the analyses, i.e., those that had rescinded expatriat voting. These were two countries, Fiji and Syrian Arab Republic. These were countries that had a score of 0 on the idea2013 variable that indicates in which year the country implemented expatriate voting.

I fit a separate Cox proportional hazard multiple regression models to the data because there is an indication of an event over time (that only occurs once), and we are interested in factors that make the event more likely. I tested the hypothesis that if the six neighboring countries of a country change their presence of overseas voting, it is more likely that the country under investigation also does in the next two years.

I use this variable to compare the frequency with which Senators provided such a response in a reply to the pro-immigration letter relative to the frequency that they did so in response to the anti-immigration letter. In my analysis, I combine Senators who did not respond at all into the same category as those who responded, but did not include a statement about the pro-immigration actions they have taken. Combining these two groups seems appropriate because, in either case, the letter writer cannot learn about the senator's pro-immigration actions from the response. If I instead excluded these senators from analysis, the estimates would be biased if the content of the letter affected whether they receive a response. The results below therefore avoid differential nonresponse and attrition bias, but should be thought of as an intention-to-treat analysis since non-response may also occur because senators (or their staff) never read the initial letter and thus could not be influenced by its content.

My task was: 
You should calculate the change in the housing values between 1970 and 1980 in your analysis. You should not control for riot activity in city, share of black on block, the number of rooms on block, You should not drop borders with early plans (in 1960). You should not drop borders with plans on both sides You should not drop Los Angeles borders. You should disregard the number of steps in court order and the number of years since order passed.
I used the same code and procedure as I did from Task 1, but focused my analysis on a single test.
The author mentions in the original paper that the data comes from the Census of Housing in 1970 and 1980. I began by merging the data from 1970 and 1980. Next, I make cleaning adjustments noted by the author, including correcting several cases of miscoded variables or values. As the author did, I drop schools in the South (Georgia), which may have been exposed to earlier cases of desegregation and due to the definition of school districts. Blocks are assigned to “city” or “suburb” based on which side has the largest population. I limit the sample to a balanced panel of city-suburb pairs, that is, I only include areas whose counterpart also appears and that appear in both years. 
In accordance with the claim to be tested, I focus on housing prices and test the hypotheses: 
H0a: School desegregation had no effect on housing prices in urban areas relative to nearby suburban areas. 
H1a: School desegregation affected housing prices in urban areas relative to nearby suburban areas. 
In order to assess the impacts of desegregation policies on housing prices given data on the same areas over the period from 1970 to 1980, I used difference-in-differences to compare the growth in housing prices between 1970 and 1980 between affected urban areas and nearby unaffected suburbs. The benefit to difference-in-differences is that it allows for us to control for any time-invariant unobserved differences between treated and control units. The identifying assumption is that treated and control units have parallel counterfactual trends. In the most basic version of this model, I use the two-way fixed effects estimator, including fixed effects at the treatment level (the school district) and the year. I take the log of housing prices and rents. Standard errors are clustered at the level of treatment, the school district level. In addition, observations are weighted by the population in the area, in order to allow for interpretation as a population-level average effect. 
However, since the data contains information on several blocks per school district, I also include more controls to account for any potential unobserved heterogeneity. The addition of these controls should have no effect on the estimate unless they are related to the treatment effect or there is a violation of the parallel counterfactual trends assumption. They may, however, affect the precision of the estimate. I test a specification including a time trend for urban areas (urban * year fixed effect), as well as a time trend for each border area (border * year fixed effect). These allow for different growth rates of housing prices or rents in urban areas, as well as different growth rates in each border area. This is the main specification.

I tested a series of linear models predicting mean standardized midterm and final test scores (same outcome as in paper) as a function of the proportion of 5 peers that were girls, along with several combinations of covariates of interest: student gender, baseline test scores, and subject interest. 

I focused on simple slopes analysis of Model 3 as the clearest test of the basic claim given the specific details requested of this task. In this model, test scores are predicted by baseline test scores, student gender, peer gender proportion (of 5 surrounding peers), and the interaction of student gender and peer gender proportion, while excluding favored students (who were not randomly assigned to their seats). I focus on the simple slope for girl students in this model because the specific claim highlighted is about the effect among girls, rather than the difference between effects among girls and boys (i.e., the interaction term).

In this model, being surrounded by a higher proportion of girls predicted higher test scores among girl students, b = 0.26 (SE = 0.09), t(608) = 2.79, p = .006. The magnitude of this change corresponds with the original claim of .2-.3 standard deviation increases going from all boy peers (i.e., 0% girl peers) to all girl peers (100% girl peers). 

Moreover, this pattern finding was generally robust to other obvious combinations of predictors (see summaries of full models below). In particular, being surrounded by more girls predicted higher scores, whether or not prior test scores were controlled for (models 1v2) and whether or not subject interest was also controlled for (models 1v4, 2v5).

I use the `sjPlot` and `sjtable2df` packages, as well as the `summary` function, to identify and report the t-statistic, the degrees of freedom, sample size, and p-value for the 'create 1000 local jobs' feature. It is important to note that I am reporting these values against baseline of 'no impact' (i.e. the effect of job creation, relative to no job market impact, on respondent preferences for the FDI project).

The t-statistic for 'create 1000 local jobs', with 'no impact [on the job market]' as a baseline, is 12.837. Given the model is clustered at the respondent level, the degrees of freedom are 2686.  The p-value is <0.001 (the summary function provides a specific p-value of 1.195e-36).",t-statistic,12.837,22768,2686,p-value,1.195e-36 (<0.001),"A FDI project that leads to job creation is favoured by respondents more than a project that has either no impact or a negative one.

To test this hypothesis, I compared two groups (those with a fast life strategy and those with a slow life strategy) and conducted a t-test. I first created two groups based on the sum score of the Mini-K measure. Negative values are associated with a fast life strategy and positive values with a slow life strategy. Therefore, every participant with a sum score equal to or smaller than -1 was assigned to the fast life strategy group (value = 0), and every participant with a sum score equal to or greater than 1 was assigned to the slow life strategy group (value = 1). There were two participants with a sum score between -1 and 1. Those were excluded from analysis because their score did not indicate a clear preference for a slow or fast life strategy. For total DSM5 scores, the dependent variable, Levene’s test accepted the null hypothesis of equal population variances, F(1,134) = 0.165, p = .686. However, a Shapiro-Wilk test showed that the distribution of the data in the slow life strategy group were not normally distributed (W = 0.846, p < .001).

Statistical analyses were performed with R 4.2.0 (R Core Team, 2022), using estimatr 0.30.6. (Blair et al., 2020) for calculating heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors. 
The normal distribution of the residuals was tested by skewness and kurtosis indices. Although the values of kurtosis extended even the less strict limit of +/-2, according to Knief and Forstmeier (2021, p. 2577) ""Gaussian models are robust to non-normality over a wide range of conditions, meaning that p values remain fairly reliable except for data with influential outliers judged at strict alpha levels."" Consequently, linear regression model was used during the analysis. The Breusch-Pagan test (Breusch, & Pagan, 1980) and the Non-constant Variance Score Test (Fox, & Weisberg, 2011) showed that the assumption of homoscedasticity was violated in the model, thus following the recommendation of Long and Ervin (2000), parameter estimates were calculated using heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors (HC3).
Linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association of a country’s median age (ages between 20 and 64 years) with new business formation. Following the instructions for task 2, all countries were included in the analysis, but the predictor of median age (r) and control variables were not included in the analysis. The analysis was conducted with the above-mentioned parameters, investigating new business formation (H1) in general (regardless of whether it pays wages or not).

Apart from removing observation from years not included in the study period, no other data processing was carried out. Only variables constructed by the author of the original paper were used. 
The empirical claim to be tested is ""... city leaders with informal ties to the incumbent provincial leaders deliver ... faster economic growth than those without. (p. 982.)"". The dependent variable is economic growth ('gdpidx'), the main independent variable of interest is whether the mayor is linked to the province leader(relying on the definition used in the original paper; 'mayor2currentsec'). The starting assumption is that the issue is dynamic: current growth will likely be influenced by past growth. Similarly, actions of politicians as well as developments in general, likely need time to take effect. Thus, also lags of the independent variables need to be considered in the model. The required dynamic panel regression models quickly become complex, especially when the number of lags need to be determined. This is the case here, as there is no clear theoretic reasoning for and against a certain number of lags. This requires to only consider a relatively sparse set of controls: with respect to the economic conditions, include the absolute level of GDP (in logs, 'loggdp'), whether the city has national-level special economic zone ('anysez_nat'), and the public spending (fiscal spending in % of GDP; 'govsize'). Note that 'loggdp' will only be included starting from the first lag. In order to at least control partially for other factors relating to the mayors characteristic, the mayors education is also included ('mayor_edu').
A dynamic panel ‘twoway’ model (including individual and time effects) was estimated using the System-GMM-estimator. Due to the additional instructions (“""You should calculate overall GDP growth rate (at t+2) instead of sector-specific GDP growth rate. You should control for city economic and city leader variables.“), the maximum number of lags included in the model was restricted to two. 
The specification search led to the following lag structure: gdpidx ~ lag(gdpidx,1:2) + lag(mayor2currentsec,0:2) + lag(anysez_nat,0:2) + lag(mayor_edu,0:2) + lag(govsize,0:2) + lag(loggdp,1:2). All available lags were used as GMM-instruments per default, the two-step estimator was applied and robust standard errors are presented.
In order to test the hypothesis that ties between a city’s mayor and the province leader lead to higher GDP growth, the statistical significance of the parameter estimate of the second lag of ‘mayor2currentsec’ was considered (relying on standard NHST outputs, but using HC-standard errors). The finding is that the estimate cannot be considered statistically significant (parameter estimate: 0.099; SE: 0.0.133; z-value: 0.746; p-value 0.456).",z-statistic,0.746,3995,306,p-value,0.456,The estimated effect of the city leaders informal ties in year t on the GDP-growth in year t+2 cannot be considered statistically significant.,Same as claimed by the original study,No,Yes,25,354

1. The following will be ignored: Oil Rents, Economic Growth, Government Debt, FDI, Inflation, Federalism, Regime Type.
2. Instruments are not used separately for each time period.
3. Standard errors are not adjusted with Windmeijer’s finite sample correction.
4. Instruments are not reduced by principal component. 

Thus, the author's statistical result of interest is column 1 of Table 2. 

Two-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation is used. The dependent variable is Credit to Government and SOEs (Directed Credit), credittogovtstateenterp. The main independent variable for testing the hypothesis of a negative relationship is State Capacity (IQG), icrg_qog. Other independent variables include a lagged dependent variable (LDV) and Private Credit. Each independent variable is treated as potentially endogenous and is thus instrumented with their lags. A linear time trend is included. As suggested by Roodman (2009a), to avoid the danger of instrument proliferation that is present with GMM estimation, the instrument matrix is reduced via collapsing; also reported are the instrument counts and the result of the difference-in-Hansen test, which tests the validity of a subset of instruments under the null of joint validity of all instruments. 

As a robustness check, I re-estimate the original specification using the forward orthogonal deviations transformation. As Roodman (2009b) explains, the first-difference transform's weakness is magnifying gaps in unbalanced panels; however, rather than subtracting the previous observation from the contemporaneous one, orthogonal deviations transform minimizes data loss by subtracting the average of all future available observations of a variable. Hayakawa (2009) finds the GMM estimator using forward orthogonal deviations tends to outperform that of the first-differences model. 

For the dataset, I use the author's ""Country Year Dataset"". No preprocessing steps have been conducted. As the author's ""Software Commands Paper"" file mentions, the dataset was already primed for panel data analysis. I use Stata version 16 to conduct this analysis. 

Conclusion

This re-analysis finds evidence supporting the selected claim from the original study that ""... after controlling for the profit potential implied by financial repression, as states grow weaker they increase the amount of credit directed to the government and SOEs."" (p. 463.). The negative coefficient on State Capacity (IQG) is statistically significant and robust to the usage of orthogonal deviations transformation. In both specifications, the test for AR(2) fails to reject the null hypothesis of no second-order serial correlation. Likewise, the Hansen test of overidentifying restrictions fails to reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are orthogonal to the error term, and the difference-in-Hansen test also fails to reject the null of valid instruments. In contrast to my approach in Task 1, a key change in Task 2's approach that yields statistically significant results is the exclusion of Windmeijer’s correction from the orthogonal deviations specification.

Private Credit (% GDP) is credit provided to the private sector by domestic money banks. Indicator of Quality of Government is the average of the Corruption, Law and Order, and Bureaucracy indexes.

All these three data variables can be found in the ""Country Year Dataset.dta"" file, with the variable names of credittogovtstateenterp, privatecredit, icrg_qog, respectively.

In the main table of the Country Year Dataset, there is no data for each year and each country. Eliminating missing variables resulted in data from 130 countries for 1984 to 2011. The amount of available data from each country varies drastically, where some countries have data for less than five years. For this reason, I included only the countries with more than ten years of data in the subsequent analysis.

Linear mixed model was used for statistical analysis in the main study. Since economics is not my field of expertise, I am not familiar with the econometrics tools and their theoretical backgrounds. Therefore, I used a different statistical method suitable for the hypothesis to be tested without making any changes in the variables selected for hypothesis testing.

I set up a Linear Mixed Model, in order to predict Directed-Credit with using Private-Credit, QoG and Year. I included the country as a random effect variable. Since the data from the same country (compared to other countries) will be more related to each other, making a multiple regression by ignoring the hierarchical data structure of the variables would violate the assumption of independence. There were no concerning collinearity issue among the predictors (VIF = 1.662). As mentioned in Menaldo et al. (2016), the financial development measures of the countries are directly influenced by the country's past years. Hence, I decided to include random slope for year, Private-Credit, and QoG using a covariance matrix that assumes values become less correlated over time. I chose the ARH(1), first order heterogenous autoregressive structure matrix.
Starting with the most basic one, I conducted 4 different models following the steps below. I also report the -2LL scores for each model which is used to assess the significance of the change in the model.

1. Base Model (-2LL = 20276, df = 5 )
Fixed effects only model. 

Directed-Credit = b0 + b1(Year) + b2(Private-Credit) + b3 (QoG)


2.Model (-2LL = 17814, df = 6)
Country is added as a random effect with intercept. 

Directed-Credit = b0 + b1(Year) + b2(Private-Credit) + b3(QoG) + (1 | Country)


3.Model (-2LL = 16852, df = 8)
Year is added as a random slope with a covariance matrix of first order heterogenous autoregressive structure matrix. 

Directed-Credit = b0 + b1(Year) + b2(Private-Credit) + b3(QoG) + (1 + Year | Country)

4.Model (-2LL = 16196, df = 10)
Private-Credit and QoG are also included as random slope with a covariance matrix of first order heterogenous autoregressive structure matrix. 

Directed-Credit = b0 + b1(Year) + b2(Private-Credit) + b3(QoG) + (1 + Year + Private-Credit + QoG | Country)

According to the result of the analysis, when the hierarchical structure is not taken into account, a significant relationship is observed between the QoG and directed-credit (after controlling for private credit) in the 1st model, F(1, 2.659) = 23.78, p < .001. However, in this way, I would violate the independence assumption because the data from the same country will be more related to each other. For this reason, I enabled the intercepts of each country to vary freely. Also, for each country, I enabled the slopes for year, private-credit and QoG to vary across countries. Each addition to the base model was observed to increase the model fit significantly (see the reduced -2LL). The significance is checked by chi-square against a respective change in degrees of freedom. According to the result of the 4th model, the QoG could not significantly predict the directed credit value (after controlling for private credit). No significant relationship was observed, F(1, 127.39) = .225, p = .636. The direction of the non-significant relationship was found in the negative direction as similar with the article (b = -1.24). 

The relationship between quality of government and credits directed to government or SOEs has shown significant variance in intercepts, and the slopes varied across countries.

2022-08-06T16:22:02Z,K0XHI,Platt_Boustan_AmEcoJourn_2012_PVQK,Stata,"As a second task, I was asked to estimate the impact of court-ordered desegregation of public schools in central cities on housing prices and rents using data from Boustan (2012) following the instructions below on sample selection and the use of controls.

Your analysis should produce a single, main result in terms of statistical families of z-, t-, F-, or χ² tests (or their alternative or non-parametric versions).
You should calculate the change in the housing values between 1970 and 1980 in your analysis. You should not control for riot activity in city, share of black on block, the number of rooms on block, You should not drop borders with early plans (in 1960). You should not drop borders with plans on both sides You should not drop Los Angeles borders. You should disregard the number of steps in court order and the number of years since order passed.

I used the same analysis plan as in task 1, however, I included observations I had previously dropped. To estimate the effect of court-ordered desegregation, I compare the change housing prices in Census blocks on either side of a school district boundary between 1970 and 1980, for school district boundaries where one district was ordered by a court to desegregate. To account for time trends in urban versus suburban housing prices, I compare this change to a control group of urban-suburban school district pairs where neither was ordered by a court to desegregate. This control group addresses the possibility that relative prices at the boundary between urban and suburban school districts was changing for other reasons over this time period.

Data on housing prices and rents originally came from the 1970 and 1980 waves of the Census of Housing. This data is self-reported by survey respondents. Boustan (2012) used census maps to “identify pairs of neighboring city and suburban school districts” for which this data was available and identified which census blocks were directly on the borders. Data on desegregation court orders originally came from the State of Public School Integration website. 

Following Boustan (2012), I limit attention to Census blocks on the border between a central city school district and a suburban school district. The data from Boustan (2012) does not include data on southern school districts or “borders that are obstructed by a body of water, industrial land, a railroad, or a four-lane highway.” 

To compare relative housing prices on either side of a school district boundary, before and after court-ordered desegregation, I use a difference-in-differences-in-differences, or triple-difference, design. The first difference is the difference between housing prices on either side of a school district boundary, the second difference is the change in this difference between 1970 and 1980, and the third difference is the difference between those central city-suburban school district pairs where one was ordered by a court to desegregate and the central city-suburban school district pairs where neither was ordered by a court to desegregate. As a minor note, Boustan (2012) calls this a difference-in-difference analysis in relative prices. I consider the “relative prices” part to be a third difference.

My outcomes of interest is the natural logarithm of mean housing prices.

To implement my triple difference design, define three variables: urban_school_district_i denotes whether the Census block is in the central city school district, 1980_t denotes whether the year is 1980, and treated_border_i denotes whether the Census block is along a border where the central city school district was subject to a court order to desegregate. In the one case where the suburban school district was subject to a court order to desegregate, I set treated_border_i to negative one.

I use the following regression specification:
Log(mean housing prices)_{it) = beta_0 + beta_1 * treated_border_i + beta_2 * urban_school_district_i + beta_3 * 1980_t + beta_4 * treated_border_i * urban_school_district_i + beta_5 * treated_border_i * 1980_t + beta_6 urban_school_district_i * 1980 + beta_7 * treated_border_i * urban_school_district_i * 1980_t + epsilon_{it} 

The coefficient of interest is beta_7, and the null hypothesis is that beta_7 equals zero.

I cluster my standard errors at the school district level, which is the level at which treatment is assigned.

My point estimate for beta_7 is -0.080, with a standard error of 0.11 and a 95% confidence interval of (-0.298, 0.137). I thus fail to reject the null hypothesis.

I also ran specifications where I included a fixed effect for each Census tract. Doing so changed the point estimates, but I still failed to reject the null hypothesis.",t-statistic,-0.731,5222,147,p-value,0.466,I find no evidence that desegregating central city school district impacts house prices.,Opposite as claimed by the original study,Yes,Yes,7,370

The main predictor variables were (a) certainty computed as the average of 7 items of the attitude certainty scale, and (b) objective ambivalence which was computed with the Thompson and Zanna (1995, p.263) formula:  (positive + negative)/2 - |positive - negative|

Of the 492 participants, only 174 provided data at Time 2, so only 174 cases were used in subsequent analyses.

First, I conducted a descriptive analysis of the relevant variables, proximity to elites and turnout. The goal was to get know their distributions and detect any possible anomalies.
To test the hypothesis about bivariate relation between turnout and proximity, I computed a point-biserial correlation between them. I conducted this test because it allows detecting associations between one quantitative and one dichotomous variable. I found a significant (although weak) association in the two datasets analyzed.

Then I computed logistic regression models with turnout as the dependent variable, and with all the control variables as predictors. I compared this model with another model including the focus predictor (proximity to elites) as an additional predictor.

This procedure allows to examine the relation between proximity to elites and turnout, while controlling for a set of variables that can also explain differences in turnout. I.e., it allows examining whether proximity explains additional variance in turnout, after all the variance explained by the control variables has already been accounted for. 

For both data sets, the increase in model fit was statistically significant, although the percentage of reduction of the deviance was rather low. This implies that proximity to elites is a relevant predictor of turnout (therefore, they are related).

Finally, I used a simplified version of the model to make turnout predictions based on proximity to elites. The goal was to better understand how differences in proximity were associated with turnout.

The data provided was not the exact data used in the mplus analysis. Instead, it was stored in as a “sav” file. This format made it more challenging to work with the data and to verify that the data provided was equivalent to the original. After some pre-processing, I was able to structure the provided data file to exactly reproduce the mplus output, using a newer version of mplus v8.3. A visual inspection of the original output and the reproduced confirmed that the data matched. Unfortunately, it also became clear that my design choices were limited compared to the original authors. Model.

Furthermore, I also chose to use an actor–partner interdependence models (APIM) because it is the most appropriate for their conceptual model in figure 1. Models were fit in mplus v8.3 using a robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR). My modeling approach for stage 2 did not differ from stage 1, beyond extracting the test statistic for the indirect effects. I did another round of models where I fully bootstrapped the model using a non-robust maximum likelihood estimator. It showed comparable results, so I didn’t include those in the write up.

To account for the non-independence of observations, I nested bishops’ responses within the country of service using mPlus 8.0 (Asparouhov, 2005; Muthén & Satorra, 1995). As bishops have done their duty in the same country contexts, the responses were nested within countries (two levels). In the multivariate model, I regressed two binary outcomes (voting conservative vs progressive on the Sources of Revelation and the First Vote on the Blessed Virgin Mary) on the predictors sorted as Religious Competition Variables and Neo-Institutional Variables. Religious Competition Variables included Market Share (percent Catholic), Countries with Religious Freedom (dummy coded), Countries with Another Established Religion (dummy coded), and interactions Percent Catholic x Religious Freedom, Percent Catholic x Another Established Religion. Neo-Institutional Variables included Incumbency (RCC is an incumbent, dummy coded), Field Stability (change in percent Catholic), Structurated (by a strong Protestant presence, dummy coded), and interactions Incumbency x Structurated, Stability x Incumbency, Stability x Structurated, Stability x Religious Freedom, and Stability x Another Established Religion.
I used a weighted least-square with mean and variance correction estimator (WLSMV) fit the multivariate model with binary outcomes (Muthen & Muthen, 2012). I calculated the same number of parameters that a model can estimate, so I expected that the model would have perfect fit indices (Barbeau et al., 2019). I present the data and the code used for analyses in supplementary materials. To examine whether variables derived from Religious Competition Theory and Neo-Institutional Theory predict bishops’ votes, I examined the 95% confidence intervals for regression coefficients. The hypotheses would be supported if the 95% confidence intervals for regression coefficients will not include zero. For instance, the percentage of Catholics in a given country would be a significant predictor of bishops’ conservatism if the regression coefficient would be negative, and the 95% confidence intervals for regression coefficients will not include zero.

Results
In my analysis, I included only bishops that voted in two votes (N = 1627). The model had perfect fit χ2 (27) = 496.69, p < .01, RMSEA = .00, CFI = 1.00, SRMR = 0.00. Full results are presented in Table 1. I found that both - Religious Competition Variables and Neo-Institutional Variables – predicted the voting conservatism among bishops (Table 2). Thus, variables derived from both theories - Religious Competition Theory and Neo-Institutional Theory - co-lead bishops to prioritize ecumenical concerns over the concerns about their institutions’ efficiency. I did not observe difference in ecumenical concerns between the fields embedded or not embedded by Protestants.

My aim is to test wether the wage gain at migration decreases as the number of years of schooling of the migrants increase.
The analysis shows that people who did not attend school (or went to school for less than 9 years in total) gain more at migration in term of wage increase. This is confirmed by the fact that the only significant variables are ""no school"" and ""some high school"".In particular, we can also note that the magnitude and the significance of the coefficients increase as the years of school decrease.

Two different data files were created, one corresponding closet to the original data set (original MIDUS and Japan MIDUS wave 1) and another corresponding to a more recent data set to increase the number of participants (original MIDUS, refresher MIDUS, both waves of the Japan data set). Due to overlapping participants in the two Japan samples, only one observation was included depending on which time point had the most complete data for the primary measures. If both time points had similarly completed measures, then the first sample was taken to be closest to the original analysis. The HDL adjusted scores were used from the Japan samples. All cholesterol measures were log transformed. For Task 2 requirements, a chronic conditions variable was calculated by summing the presence of heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and diabetes. If participants had all NA responses for each of the conditions, an NA response also was given to the score. Items for the positive and negative affect scores were separately averaged, not including any NA values in the calculation. Culture was effect coded as .5 for United States and -.5 for Japan. Due to a large degree of missing variables, especially for the health-related measures, multiple imputation techniques were implemented. We tested the hypothesis that “positive affect was associated with healthier lipid profiles for Americans but not for Japanese.” One measures of lipid profiles as used to assess the hypothesis: HDL. The alpha level was set at .05. In accordance with STROBE guidelines, all analyses were first conducted without any covariates and were then followed by analyses with covariates. If large changes in the beta weights occurred for the primary hypothesis (the positive affect x culture interaction), the changes were investigated in exploratory analyses. Because negative affect was highly correlated with positive affect (r=-.63), potentially inducing collinearity in the model, this measure was entered last into the analyses. All analyses were conducted with linear regression in R. Results. For HDL in the original sample, the positive affect x culture interaction was not significant (p=.27) before adjusting for covariates.

The main objective of the analysis is to produce a single main result by focusing on access to new primary school as the key dependent variable and controlling for local need and geographic factors.

The econometric specification used is conditional logit model with robust standard errors clustered at the local government level. The results show the odds ratio.


Dependent variable

1.	New_Schools_T1: Binary variable indicating access to a new school during 2002-09.

Independent variable

1.	Congruence_20km_T1: A discount-decay function of a village's congruence with the dominant level of precolonial centralization in the local government, thus that a village receives a 1 if it is 'congruent' and a 0 if not; coded by time period with centralization measured as a 20km buffer from a key precolonial power center.


Control variables

Control variables can be divided into two main categories: (1) geographic suitability: these variables control for geographic factors that might impact the likelihood of access to schools and clinics, for instance, the elevation of the village, latitude and longitude of the coordinates of the village and whether are rainforest or grasslands within that region, and (2) local need: these variables present the need of infrastructure facilities within a community, for instance, local population and population density.

2.	LnPop2011: Logged village population
3.	Latitude: Village’s latitude
4.	Longitude: Village’s longitude
5.	Village_Elevation: village elevation in meters
6.	LnD_waterway: logged distance between a village and the nearest navigable waterway
7.	Mangrove:  0-1 measure that takes a 1 when a village falls within a Mangrove

First, we had to divide the sample into two contrasting groups based on the level of openness to experience. However, all participants had several scores on openness to experience because in the original study they were asked to complete two or three measures simultaneously. The measures were NEO–PI–3, NEO–FFI–3, and BFAS. Most participants completed only NEO–FFI–3 and BFAS (n = 379; referred to as “samples 1–3”) while others completed all three measures (n = 137; referred to as “sample 2”). I conducted a correlation analysis using Pearson’s correlation coefficient that revealed a high inter-relationship between the results of three measures (rs = .63–.89). Next, I proceeded with the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) in order to extract estimated factor scores for openness to experience as a latent variable. The EFA was performed separately for “sample 1–3” and “sample 2” based on the matrix of Pearson’s correlation coefficients using principal axis factoring (PAF). For each sample estimated factor scores were obtained following Bartlett’s method. After joining factor scores across samples, we calculated the median of factor scores’ distribution to use it further in forming comparison groups. The choice of median as a threshold was justified by the need to have an equivalent or a comparable number of participants in each group to preserve the maximum statistical power in testing networks’ structural parameters (see details below). Thus, I divided the whole sample (N = 516) into groups of “low” (factor score < median) and “high” (factor score ≥ median) openness to experience. Second, I preprocessed the data on the verbal fluency (VF) task in order to proceed with the network analysis allowing to examine macro-level network parameters reflecting the structural architecture of semantic memory. Although participants could generate up to 50 responses, close examination of missing values uncovered that the maximum number of responses equaled 35. Thus, we eliminated all columns with 100% of missing values (m = 15) and proceeded further with the remaining columns. The next logical step was an application of text-cleaning algorithms compiled in such R packages as “SemNetCleaner” and “SemNetDictionaries”, which auto-corrected all potential errors and typos based on the animals’ dictionary (i.e., a collection of more than 1000 nouns designating various animals) and converted VF responses into binary matrices. After that, we finalized matrices so that each VF response has been given by at least two participants, equated responses across the networks for two groups (i.e., “low” and “high” openness), estimated words similarity using Pearson’s correlation, estimated both networks with Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG; the only filtering method implemented in “SemNeT” package for correlation-based networks), and plotted them against each other to visually inspect their difference. Lastly, we conducted statistical computations based on two networks. The preliminary step was to define the most appropriate networks’ property to establish the level of inter-connectedness between semantic units because it was the main aim of the initial research claim. Taking into account previous studies on the relationship between the structure of semantic memory and various creativity facets, we finished with three macro-level network parameters as potential candidates: (a) average shortest path length (ASPL; an average shortest number of edges needed to get between any pair of nodes), (b) clustering coefficient (CC; the extent that two neighbors of a node will be neighbors themselves), and (c) maximum modularity coefficient (Q; how well networks partitions in smaller networks). Since the hypothesis focused on the interconnection between nodes in two groups and only one result of statistical analysis was allowed, we limited the scope of our analysis to the ASPL. The choice of ASPL was predetermined by the fact that the corresponding indicator reflects the average shortest number of edges needed to move between a pair of nodes. Thus, the shorter average distances imply tighter connections among nodes in the network. In addition, according to the task instruction, the number of preserved nodes in the partial networks was fixed to 90%. After computing ASPL parameter for “low” and “high” openness groups, we run a test to confirm that the obtained VF networks’ parameter corresponded to the Watts-Strogatz model (“small-world model”) rather than to the Erdős-Rényi model (“random network”). The latter suggestion was successfully established using Viger and Latapy’s Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with 1000 iterations (all p-values < .001) and provided an opportunity to continue with the statistical comparison of networks’ parameter between “low” and “high” openness groups. For the latter purpose, we utilized a node-wise bootstrap approach with 1000 iterations and compared the obtained sampling distributions for ASPL using a t-test for independent samples. Results showed that lower level of openness to experience corresponded to higher average distances among nodes (ASPL; t(1998) = 57.13, p < .001, d = 2.56). In sum, our analysis corroborated the claim provided in the original publication: The group with high openness to experience compared to the group with low openness to experience had a better-connected structure of semantic memory.",t-statistic,58.033,2000,1998,p-value,< 0.001,The group with high openness to experience compared to the group with low openness to experience had a better-connected structure of semantic memory,Same as claimed by the original study,No,Yes,50,399

Each observation is a 23-minute period, and four consecutive 23-minute periods correspond to a block which starts each day at the same times (11:00 am, 12:50 pm, 3:40 pm, and 5:30 pm). Treatments were implemented at the block level, so each block contains four observations for a treatment within a day. From this data, we generate a binary variable (ask) which takes a value of 1 if the Salvation Army volunteers verbally ask for a donation to passerby’s or 0 otherwise. We then drop all non-relevant measures for Task 2 (e.g., number of people going in, amount donated, all measures related to door 2, …). Additionally, I create a variable measuring the amount of people that donate (givers) irrespective if they are getting in or out of the supermarket. I also create a dummy variable for each day the experiment took place (day) and for the block at which it took place within each day and a dummy variable that identifies the starting time of each observation within each day (time) . The objective is to test whether having volunteers ask for donations (ask=1) resulted in more people donating when it was possible to avoid the ask (i.e., when only one door was occupied). In section 2.0 of the code, I start by visually analyzing the data. To do so, I create a density estimate of the amount of people that donate for the ask and no-ask condition. It is clear that verbally asking for donations resulted in higher donations. In section 2.1 of the code, I run a regression with givers as the dependent variable and a dummy for the treatment variable (ask) as well as a dummy for each day in which the experiment took place (day) as independent variables. The errors are clustered at the time level given the potential correlation of behavior within each 23-minute period. The parameter of interest is the t-stat of the ask coefficient. This will help us test the hypothesis that asking at door 1 did not have any effect on the number of givers.

Accordingly, much of the text below can also be found in my report on Task 1. Data preparation: I follow the same data cleaning procedure as in Task 1. More specifically, I first drop all observations for which no year or country identifier is available. Second, the regression only includes observations for which the data on all covariates and outcomes is fully available (given that the method chosen is a first-difference estimator, this requires the availability of the respective first difference of each variable included in the model). In total, the resulting data used in the regression includes an unbalanced panel of 127 countries from 1987 to 2011, with a total of 2,478 observations. Thus, on average, 19.5 observations are available per country. 

Regression Framework: Basic Setup 

Given the restrictions on the estimator imposed by Task 2, it makes most sense to me to run a Fixed Effects or First Difference Estimator (FD). Given that only a single test is requested, I decided in favor of the FD estimator, given that the first part of the analysis (Task I) provided evidence that, when running fixed-effects regressions, the error term remains serially correlated. Thus, it makes sense to instead assume that it follows a random walk, as done by the first-differences estimator. The FD estimator has several advantages to more involved methods, such as GMM or 2SLS. First, it is arguably more transparent when it comes to interpreting the effects and, in particular, potential issues of the estimated coeﬀicients, such as omitted variable bias. Through this, it provides a good baseline estimate. Further, while the estimator suffers from dynamic panel bias, given the correlation of the lagged dependent variable to the error term, this bias is likely small. This is the case, given that it decreases in the number of periods available per country, which is rather high, with an average of T=19.5. However, it's of course important to acknowledge this shortcoming when interpreting the results, though other issues, such as omitted variable bias, are most probably more important to keep in mind. To run the estimator, I use the following framework: The dependent variable describes the first difference of directed credit to government and state-owned enterprises in percent of GDP at time t (minus the pre-period's value). The independent variable of interest describes the first difference of state capacity at time t. For this, I rely on the author’s ‘Indicator of Quality of Government Index’ (IQGI). This is the average of the Corruption, Law and Order, and Bureaucracy indeces provided by the author. Here, lower values indicate lower quality of governance. The claim suggests that, as the index decreases (i.e. the state becomes weaker), the amount of capital going to the state and SOEs increases. Thus, it suggests that the coefficient of the IQGI index is negative. Further, the claim proposes that this is the case after controlling for “the profit potential implied by financial repression”. This is measured by the first difference of credit provided to the private sector by financial banks in percent of GDP. The paper’s idea behind the control is the following: the profitability of the private sector may be directly affected by market failures and political capture of the credit market. While the leader aims to use financial repression to channel funds to SOEs and the state, private agents who derive benefits from politically captured financial institutions do typically not have an interest in this. Further, in weak states financial markets may be smaller (or generally differ from those in stronger states) due to market failures, meaning that potentially less money can be channeled to SOEs and the state. Given that both are also presented as channels through which the state follows its fiscal imperative, it appears hard to disentangle these channels empirically. More specifically, the theory states “[…] it is the fiscal imperative that ultimately drives both political failures and the irresolution of market failures” (p. 460). From my perspective, the cleanest way to control for ‘the profit potential of the private sector’ appears to be the first difference of the pre-period’s share of GDP of the private credit market. Two reasons are put forward for this: First, assuming states that get weaker immediately repress the financial market to channel credit to SOEs, this may directly affect (1) the outcome and (2) the contemporary share of GDP of the private credit market. The direction of the effect on (2) is unclear: on the one hand, as markets get more profitable, their share of GDP may increase. On the other hand, if the state creates monopolists, these might lower the supply of private credit and charge higher fees, which may both increase or decrease the private lending sector's share of GDP while still increasing its profitability. In any way, controlling for the contemporary share of GDP may constitute a bad control, given that changes in private lending's share of GDP may be directly affected by the state’s weakness. Second and closely related, given that both market failures and political capture are potential channels through which the financial market is repressed, it seems logical to either operationalize these channels directly (in order to study the mechanism through which state weakness affects the channeling of funds to the state and SOEs) or to run a reduced-form regression of directed credit on state capacity, as suggested by the claim. In this case, it seems useful to (if at all) control for the pre-period’s private credit market, given that otherwise one would control for both the cause of directed credit to SOEs (state weakness) and a potential channel through which the state creates the profitable financial markets that provide credit (market failures and political capture). Aside from these variables of interest, I further include the lagged dependent variable as a control. To control for global trends over time, I control for year fixed effects.

Below is the methods & results: Analytical Plan Analyses were conducted to test the hypothesis that there was a significant indirect effect from earlier paternal (but not maternal) perceived discrimination to later adolescent adjustment through paternal depressive symptoms and material hostility towards adolescents. First, descriptive statistics of study variables were extracted from the dataset, and correlation analyses were used to examine associations among study variables, using SPSS version 28. Then, the study hypothesis was tested using path analysis in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework in Mplus version 8.3 (Muthén & Muthén, 2018), using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors. This SEM model examined the effects of paternal and maternal perceived discrimination (assessed at Wave 1) on adolescent depression and delinquency (assessed at W2) through parental and maternal depression (assessed at W1) and subsequent hostility towards the adolescent (assessed at W2). This model controlled for adolescent adjustment variables assessed at Wave 1 to establish temporal precedence. In other words, the effects on the changes of adolescent adjustment from Wave 1 to Wave 2 were estimated. In addition, paternal and maternal education levels, age, immigration status, and adolescents’ age, gender, and immigration status were initially all entered as covariates. Non-significant covariates were later trimmed from the model to keep model parsimony and retain statistical power. Corresponding paternal & maternal constructs assessed at the same wave were also covaried in the SEM model. The RMediation package (Tofighi and MacKinnon, 2011) was used to estimate the indirect effects in the hypothesis. Missing data ranged from 0% to 27.3%, with an average of 13.02% across all study variables. Missing data patterns met Little’s missing completely at random assumption, χ2 (265) = 268.82, p = .42. Therefore, full-information maximum likelihood algorithm was used to estimate missing data. Model fit was assessed through χ2, the comparative fit index (CFI), and the standardized root mean residual (SRMR). Results Correlation and descriptive statistics of study variables are presented in Table 1. Study variables were correlated in the hypothesized direction. For example, both paternal and maternal perceived discrimination were significantly and positively correlated with paternal and maternal depression assessed at Wave 1 (r ranged from .18 to .37, p < .01). Only paternal depression at Wave 1 was significantly linked to elevated hostility towards children assessed at Wave 2 among both mothers (r = .19, p < .01) and fathers (r = .14, p < .05). Maternal and paternal hostility towards children were significantly associated with adolescents’ elevated depression (r ranged from .26 to .36, p < .01) and delinquency (r ranged from .13 to .24, p < .01) levels assessed at Wave 2. These correlation results indicated that the analyst could proceed with SEM hypothesis testing. In the SEM model, paternal and maternal education levels, age, immigration status, and adolescents’ age, gender, and immigration status were initially all entered as covariates. Non-significant covariates, including immigration status and ages for both parents and children, were then trimmed from the model. This model exhibited a good fit, χ2 (22) = 46.38, p = < .01, CFI = .95, SRMR = .04. Table 2 presents the model results. Accordingly, paternal perceived discrimination was significantly associated with paternal depression at Wave 1, β = .31, p < .001, but not significantly associated with maternal depression at Wave 1, β = .07, p = .13.

Additionally, I have conducted the analysis without correcting for reciprocal causation. As you can see in the last table in my results, the probit analysis without any correction, too, gave insignificant results as in the analysis without a correction in Task 1. However, this additional analysis without a statistical correction might be out of the scope of the Multi-100 project.

The instructions for Task 2 were to “produce a single, main result in terms of statistical families of z-, t-, F, or χ² tests (or their alternative or non-parametric versions). You should use the left-right dimension for the measurement of political preference. If your first analysis happened to satisfy all these instructions, you can use that for completing Task 2…. apply any statistical method that you think is the most reasonable for the analysis and it is in harmony with the instructions.” The analysis that I used for Task 1 satisfied these requirements, and so I repeated it for Task 2. Specifically, I downloaded ZA4054.sav from https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/sdesc2.asp?no=4054&db=e then used the STATA code in “Individual_dofile.do” at https://osf.io/3ypmb/?view_only=32e5fa393e44442b997bee188318394c to reconstruct the IV needed to test the claim in SPSS (“maj_fedmin” = whether a participant was a minority from a federal centre vs. a member of the ethnic majority). In other words, the IV was operationalised in the same way as it was operationalised by Rovny. The DV was also operationalised as per Rovny as “v44”, with higher scores indicating right leaning political views. As the Multi100 claim is a simple comparison of two independent means, and does not refer to any additional variables, an independent samples t-test (with the Welch correction due to heterogeneity of variances) was used for the re-analysis, with maj_fedmin as the IV (0 = ethnic majority, 1 = ethnic minority from a federal centre) and v44 as the DV. The Welch t-test was statistically significant, Welch t(827.48) = 9.51, p < .001, two-tailed, Hedges g = 0.44, 95% CI [0.34, 0.53].

The experimental data has five conditions. Each session of the experiment involved one condition. There were 2 sessions per condition, giving a total of 10 sessions. Each session contained 24 participants, giving a total of 240 participants. Each participant made decisions in 23 periods. I conduct a conservative analysis in which we average over the cooperation frequencies of a participant in the 23 rounds. This means we only have one average cooperation frequency per participant instead of 23 different cooperation frequencies per participant. This gives a total of 240 observations, with observations being clustered in sessions. I conduct an OLS regression with the average cooperation frequency as the dependent variable and the condition as the independent factor variable, and I specify session-cluster robust standard errors. Task 2 asked me to control for individual differences of the participants in the analysis. Because participants were randomly assigned over conditions, there should on average be no differences between participants in the different conditions. Of course, it may happen by chance that participants in a given condition do differ from the participants in another condition, but we can only observe this for the measured variables, and controlling for these measured variables does not solve chance differences on unobserved variables (and might in some cases even increase differences between participants on unobserved characteristics). Nevertheless, I control for three basic demographics: (1) sex (male vs female), (2) age (continuous), and (3) nationality (Italian vs non-Italian). More individual variables were available (e.g., field of study, birthplace, employment), but with only 240 participants it is unfeasible to truly control for more than a few characteristics (I did check whether additionally controlling for degree and field of study, birthplace, employment, experience with game theory, and economics affects the support for the claim, but it does not affect it). After estimating the regression, I perform a Wald test that compares the coefficient of the short-deterministic condition with the coefficient of the short-stochastic condition. This analysis also supports the claim; cooperation is higher in the short-deterministic condition than in the short-stochastic condition (F(1, 9) = 13.53, p = .005). 

NOTE: The F-test has (1,9) degrees of freedom because it is based on 10 clusters (sessions). If we would not estimate session-cluster robust standard errors, the F-statistic would be F(1,232) =10.91, p=.001). The degrees of freedom is then 232 according to the equation: sample size - parameters - 1.

2022-09-26T17:00:45Z,5BSO9,Kleven_AmEcoRev_2013_Jg9v,Stata,"The main hypothesis to be tested in Task 2 was the following: ""Did the 1991 Danish tax reform increases the share of top quality foreign players in the Danish football league?"". One potential issue with answering this question using only Danish data is that the 1990s and 2000s saw an overall increase in the share of foreign players (including top quality players) in all European countries due to the Bosman arrest (and other factors). To control for these time trends, I used a difference-in-difference test. In particular, I tested whether the increase in the share of top quality foreign players in the Danish league post the 1991 reform was significantly larger than the corresponding increase in other European countries in the same period. I answer this question using a country-level panel data set used by the authors to generate Figure 3 (on which similar analysis in the original paper was based). Similar to Task 1, I used a wild bootstrap to compute the standard errors due to a low number of independent clusters (countries), following Mackinnon and Webb (2018). I also restricted the sample to the same years the original authors used (1985 to 2008). Compared to Task 1, the only difference in the analysis in Task 2 was that I used the ""fraction of top quality foreign players"" instead of the ""ability composition of foreign players"" as the main dependent variable.

PS: I was asked to review my analysis due to the relatively low number of degrees of freedom (13) compared to the sample size (336 country X time period observations) or perhaps the t-statistic (1.38) and p-value (0.5387). To start with, Stata always sets the degrees of freedom equal to the cluster size minus one. In my case, the degrees of freedom are therefore (14-1=)13, as I previously mentioned. So I don't see a problem there. What is true, however, is that the p-value (0.5387) doesn't appear to fit the t-statistic (1.3842) well. The reason is that the t-value corresponds to the outcome of the ""standard"" regression analysis with regular clustered standard errors. The p-value, however, corresponds to the outcome of the ""wild bootstrap"" that I used, as explained in the previous paragraph. From what I understand, the wild bootstrap does not result in a test statistic; rather it only results in a p-value. However, because this form required that I report a t-test statistic with degrees of freedom, I used the ones from the regression output instead. (Incidentally, if you want to use standard clustered errors instead of the wild bootstrap the test, the p-value would be 0.190 for the two-sided p-value, and all my other conclusions would be unaffected)",t-statistic,1.3842,336,13,p-value,0.5387,There is no significant evidence that the 1991 Danish tax reform changed the share of top quality foreign players playing in the Danish league.,Opposite as claimed by the original study,No,Yes,6,417

Following the original paper, to create the combined reading and maths scores, the average was taken of the standardised variables ‘piamatsn’, ‘piarersn’ and ’piarecsn’. The whole dataset was filtered to contain only years 1985 and onwards, where total earnings was > 0, and the total earnings (‘earnincrsimp’) was divided by 1000. To test the hypothesis that an increase in total earnings is correlated with the combined maths and reading scores, a linear mixed effect model was used, implemented with the ‘lme4’ R package. Combined maths and scores was used as the response variable and total earnings was a continuous fixed factor. The mother identity (‘momid’) and child identity (‘idchild’) were included as random intercept effects to account for dependency structure within the data, including mothers having multiple children and children being tested more than once. This statistical method was chosen as it is robust and can easily account for dependency structures in the data. Model assumptions were checked using simulated residuals (Hartig 2021). Some deviation from normal was seen but it was judged as accepted since linear mixed models are highly robust (Schielzeth et al 2020). The results of the linear mixed model showed that there was a significant weak positive effect of total earnings on combined reading and math scores (z = 11.05, P < 0.001). It was estimated that for every steps 000 increase in earnings, the combined maths and reading score would increase by 0.005 (standard error = 0.0004). The majority of the variance in this model was explained by the random effects (marginal r2 = 0.007, conditional r2 = 0.753).

A binomial logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effects of “Religious Competition—from Rational Choice Theory” and “Legitimacy—from Neoinstitutional Theory” on the likelihood of a progressive vote on the Blessed Virgin Mary (“First Vote on Mary”).  A binomial logistic regression attempts to predict the probability that an observation falls into one of two categories of a dichotomous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables (continuous or categorical).  The model contained the following independent variables for “Religious Competition—from Rational Choice Theory”:  Market Share, Countries with Religious Freedom, Countries with Another Established Religion.  For “Legitimacy—from Neoinstitutional Theory,” the model contained the following independent variables: Incumbency, Field Stability, and Structurated. 

 Linearity of the continuous variables with respect to the logit of the dependent variable was assessed via the Box-Tidwell (1962) procedure; continuous independent variables were found to be linearly related to the logit of the dependent variable.  

As with the Wilde et al. (2010) article, a total of 1,921 cases were included in the analysis (65.6% of the total cases).  The logistic regression model was statistically significant, χ2(12) = 512.18, p < .001. The model explained 31.2% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in “First Vote on Mary” and correctly classified 70.7% of cases.  Sensitivity was 84.3%, specificity was 56.9%, positive predictive value was 66.4% and negative predictive value was 78.1%. 
As presented in Table 2, none of the variables associated with “Religious Competition—from Rational Choice Theory” were found to be significant.  The “Structurated” variable was the only predictor variable that was statistically significant.  This means that increasing the structurated field by a strong Protestant presence was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of progressive vote on the Blessed Virgin Mary.  In addition, the following interaction variables associated with “Legitimacy—from Neoinstitutional Theory” were also found to be significant and associated with a higher likelihood of a progressive vote: “Incumbency X Structurated,” “Stability X Religious Freedom,” and “Stability X Stucturated.”  In addition, the interaction variable “Stability X Incumbency” was also significant but associated with a lower likelihood of a progressive vote on the Blessed Virgin Mary.",Chi²-statistic,512.18,1921,12,p-value,<0.001,"Wilde et al.'s causal claim:

The causal claim made in Wilde et al. (2010) cannot be evaluated with the available dataset provided by the Center for Open Science project (OSF).   In other words, from the data and the correlative analysis, it is impossible to determine if the NIT characteristics ""lead leaders to prioritize concerns"" about legitimacy over efficiency. 

However, this analysis found that a progressive vote was more positively associated with concerns for legitimacy (as described by Neoinstitutional Theory) over efficiency (Rational Choice Theory).  This overall finding was found to be statistically significant even though increased Protestent structuration was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of a progressive vote on the Blessed Virgin Mary (Neoinstitutional Theory would suggest that increased structuration would be associated with an increased likelihood of a progressive vote).",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",4,419

My  first  task  within  the  `Multi100'  project  was  to  independently  re-analyzeTeney's (2016) nding that `poor economic performances:::decrease positivedimensions of EU framing.'My  second  task  in  the  `Multi100'  project  is  to  re-analyze  Teney's  (2016)nding  that  `poor  economic  performances:::decrease  positive  dimensions  ofEU framing' with the following guidance:`Your analysis should produce a single, main result in terms of statisticalfamilies  ofz,t,F,  or2tests  (or  their  alternative  or  non-parametricversions).`You should disregard contextual variables related to the EU policies andparty EU salience and party EU positions indexes in your analysis.`You should use the positive non-materialist form of EU framing in youranalysis.`You should use the unemployment rate as the measure for poor economicperformance in your analysis.'In fact I had already done that in the previous task:  Figure 5 (Panel A2)and Table 4 reported the association between the unemployment rate and the`Cosmopolitan'  outcome  (the  `positive  non-materialist  form  of  EU  framing').For  this  regression  coecient  I  reported  standard  errors  (in  Figure  5)  and  ap-value (in Table 4), but hey, here I will do this again, this time also reportinga test statistic.In addition, I will use an additional data set that Teney (2016) probably alsoused.  Teney (2016) reports twice to be using one data set referred to as Euro-barometer 10.1.  This is obviously wrong as there is no Eurobarometer 10.1 andEurobarometer 10 was collected in the 1970's rather than during the observationwindow stated in Teney (2016).1
Just before submitting Task 1 it occurred to me that Eurobarometer 10.1 isprobably just a typo for Eurobarometer 70.1.  Here I'll incorporate Eurobarom-eter 70.1 in the analyses.MaterialsI have received two Stata do-les `eball.do' and `ebmlESR.do' aswell as an author note reading `The required data to replicate my analyses canbe downloaded on the Gesis repository website.  I am not allowed to forwardthe Eurobarometer data.  Enclosed you'll nd the code to combine the dierentEurobarometer data waves and the code for the analysis of theESRpiece.'Potential reasons for deviationsThis is a tough one based on the materialsat hand for several reasons.It is not clear what data is being used.  Teney (2016, p.  620) reports thatthe `analysis is based on the pooled data of 16 [Eurobarometer] waves thattook place at least once a year between March 2004 and May 2013 (EB61.0,  62.0,  63.4,  64.2,  65.2,  67.2,  69.2,  10.1,  72.4,  73.4,  74.2,  75.3,  76.3,77.3, 78.1, 79.3).'  Note that `10.1' stands in the middle of the otherwiseordered list.  This is probably a mistake, Eurobarometer 10.1 must havebeen collected in the 1970's.  I assume that Eurobarometer 10.1 is a typoand should refer to Eurobarometer 70.1.Adding  the  problem,  the  Stata  do-le  `eball.do'  that  (partially)  docu-ments the data preparation suggests that the analyses also draw on addi-tional Eurobarometer waves not mentioned in the article.Importantly, the two treatment variables indicating `poor economic per-formances' are not included in the Eurobarometer data.  The only infor-mation on those variables reported in Teney (2016) is:  `The gravity of theeconomic crisis for the population is measured with an indicator of changein the economic performance and an indicator of (absolute) involvement inthe economic process, namely the annual gross domestic product (GDP)growth  and  unemployment  rates  (Eurostat,  2014).'   Eurostat  (2014)  isa generic reference to the Eurostat database which does not specify thetreatment variables any further,  and also the temporal dimension|howthe Eurostat data was merged to the (somewhat unevenly timed) Euro-barometer data|is left unexplained in the article and is also not shownin the Stata do-les.  This makes it dicult to replicate the Teney (2016)ndings.The modeling strategy of Teney (2016) is not crystal clear.  While the hy-pothesis `poor economic performances:::decrease positive dimensions ofEU framing' seems reasonably straightforward (e.g.x;y<0), the modelused by Teney (2016) to test the hypothesis is not.Teney (2016, Table 3) uses a random-eects model (variance componentsfor  survey  waves  and  country{survey  waves)  which  includes  a  range  ofvariables next to the treatment:  Sex, age, education, a set of dummy vari-ables indicating occupational group and labor market status, and degree of2
urbanization.  I am not sure why these variables are necessary to identifyan eect of the treatment variables.  It seems unlikely to me that popula-tion composition would meaningfully confound the relationship betweeneconomic performance and perceptions of the European Union.On top of these variables, the two treatment variables unemployment rateand GDP growth are included simultaneously, which I nd a questionablechoice.  Why would GDP growth net of unemployment, or unemploymentnet of GDP growth be a good measure of economic performance?Further,  quadratic terms of the two treatment variables are included inthe equation.Finally, the two treatment variables are each interacted with two dummyvariables indicating respondent's education.It is not exactly clear to me how to interpret the coecients pertaining tothe treatment variables, particularly when the hypothesis only species adirect linear eect.The analysis in Teney (2016) leaves a lot of researcher degrees of freedom.The four outcome variables are based on complex data analyses of manymeasurements detailed in a dierent article (Teneyet al., 2014), thus I donot question whether the variables are valid and reliable measures of theintended construct.What  I  do  note  however  is  that  it  seems  to  me  that  several  arbitrarydecisions are being made in the construction of the outcomes, and neitherTeney (2016) nor I take the time to assess the robustness of the ndingsto these decisions.DataEurobarometerFor  my  analyses,  I  make  use  of  the  Eurobarometer  surveys  listed  in  Table  1.Note that I include the 70.1 Eurobarometer instead of the 10.1 Eurobarometer.Outcome variablesI tried following the variable construction described inTeney (2016) and in `ebmlESR.do' as closely as possible.Table??shows  that  my  attempt  at  reproducing  the  outcome  variables  isnot  bad.   Despite  one  data  set  (`10.1')  excluded,  are  relatively  close  to  theones  reported  in  Teney  (2016,  Table  1),  which  reports  .534,  .105,  .208,  .153,respectively.The number of cases reported in Table 2 is larger than the one of Teney's(2016)N= 390;373.  I assume that Teney (2016) uses listwise deletion and losescases with missing values on the covariates (sex, age, education, occupationalgroup and labor market status, and degree of urbanization) which I do not takeinto account.Figure 1 reproduces Teney's (2016) Figure 1, and again I would say that myreconstruction of the data set is reasonably close.
Eurostat dataI obtain unemployment data from Eurostat.  Specically, I am using the annualunemployment  rate  as  a  percentage  of  the  total  population  aged  20{64  years(`unertah,' `Y20-64,' `PCPOP'), shown in Figure 2.Analytical strategyWhile the complicated model which Teney (2016) uses probably makes sense totest her full battery of hypotheses, my aim is to only test the claim that \pooreconomic performances:::decrease positive dimensions of EU framing.""This can easily be done by aggregating the Eurobarometer data to the coun-try level (i.e. using the data shown in Figure 1) and using a xed-eects panelregression setup.Thus I am estimating a model with the equationyit=xit+i+uitfort= 2004;:::;2013 andi= 1;:::;N,whereyitis cosmopolitan framing andxitis unemployment.iis the unob-served time-invariant individual eect, e.g. historical and institutional factors,anduitis the error term.The virtue of the xed eects estimator is that it removes all time-constantconfounding from the equation, irrespective of whether it has been observed oris  unobserved.   Important  country  dierences  such  as  cultural  dierences  arethus accounted for.  This approach is arguably more rigorous than the randomeects model used by Teney (2016).
The data used for the models is described in Table 3. For xed-eects modelsparticularly the within-variance is important, and as Table 3 demonstrates, thewithin-variance is non-negligible for all variables.ResultTable 4 shows the association between changes in cosmopolitan meaning andchanges in unemployment rate.  A higher unemployment rate is associated withweaker support for a cosmopolitan EU framing, as was predicted by our guidinghypothesis.
ConclusionDrawing on Eurobarometer and Eurostat data from 2004 to 2013,  I was ableto  corroborate  Teney's  (2016)  nding  that  `poor  economic  performances:::decrease positive dimensions of EU framing.'This overlap in ndings is remarkable as I substantially deviate from Teney's(2016) modeling approach, removing complex interactions and control variableswhich did not make much sense to me when testing the guiding hypothesis, whileat the same time using a more rigorous xed-eects approach that controls forboth  observed  and  unobserved  time-constant  confounders.   Further,  my  datapartially deviated from Teney (2016).Further reflecting on this exercise,  I note that I was able to do almost allof the data preparation based on the description in the article alone; only forsumming up and dividing the outcome variables the Stata do-les provided bythe author were really necessary.",t-statistic,-7.169,270,1; 242,p-value,0.000,A higher unemployment rate is associated with weaker support for a cosmopolitan EU framing.,Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",10,423

[leads to] urban housing prices and rents to decline ... relative to neighboring suburbs."". The corresponding hypothesis from the paper is: ""Over the 1970s, school segregation policies lead urban housing prices to decline relative to housing prices in neighboring suburbs"". 
Data preparation: There is no possibility for me to assess the quality of the original data and data preparation. The data structure is very complex, primarily due to the combination of multiple data sources, and the hierarchical nature of the data, including states, counties, jurisdictions (= school districts = cities?!), tracts, and blocks, and the description in the data appendix is not sufficient for me to fully understand the structure of the data. I therefore trust the preparation of the data for the main analyses that were conducted in the original paper. The data preparation is done in lines 8-209 of the do-file. Observations with missing data on the dependent variable are dropped from the analysis (2440 observations), and blocks further away from the border are excluded (10127 observations), since that gives the better test of the claim that ""urban housing prices and rents [...] decline [...] relative to neighboring suburbs"".

2022-10-04T03:27:44Z,U8SV5,Fehr_AmEcoRev_2011_gdlO,R,"1. Hypothesis - The hypothesis (also referred to as ""the claim"") being tested in this analysis is the following: ""under rigid contracts much less shading occurs [than under flexible contracts]"" (Fehr et al., 2011). 2. Dataset - To test this hypothesis, I first identify a few variables of interest from the available dataset, namely contracttypec, which specifies whether the contract is rigid or flexible; qualityc, which specifies seller's quality (possible values: normal or low) and that will be employed as a proxy for the presence of shading; condition, which specifies whether observations were collected as part of the main data collection (i.e., ""Baseline"") or as part of one of the two subsequent waves of data collection conducted to check for robustness (""Reduced Flexibility"" and ""No Competition""); contractrealizedc, which is a dummy variable indicating whether the trade has taken place or not; pricec and costc, namely the final price and cost of the product; period, which indicates the round in which the trade is taking place. I then construct the following variables to be used in the analyses: (i) rigid_contract - a dummy variable equal to 1 if the contract is rigid and 0 if flexible; (ii) low_quality - a dummy variable equal to 1 if the seller's quality is low (a proxy for the presence of shading) and 0 otherwise; (iii) bad_state - a dummy variable equal to 1 if the bad state is realized and 0 otherwise; (iv) condition_text - a variable with more descriptive labels for the three different data collection waves (""baseline"" instead of 1, ""redflex"" - aka ""Reduced Flexibility"" - instead of 3, ""nocomp"" - aka ""No Competition."" 2.1 Exclusions I exclude observations from interactions in which trade has not taken place, given that these do not present the information needed to preform the analyses (i.e., sellers only make a decision on whether to shade or not after the trade has been deemed possible). This also allows me to be consistent with the instructions provided for Task 2 mentioning that I should ""disregard bad outcomes of the contracts in [my] analysis."" Other than this, given that the claim being tested does not specify whether the analysis should be conducted on a specific set of data, I run the analyses on all remaining observations as follows: first on the entire dataset, then on three sub-datasets corresponding to the three different waves of data collection (one baseline condition and two robustness treatments), to check whether results differ within treatments. 3. Outcome Variable - The outcome variable is the extent of shading. This is proxied by how frequently sellers in the study choose to provide a low quality product (rather than one of normal quality), which is constructed from the dataset as a dummy variable equal to 1 if quality is low and thus shading is present, or 0 if quality is normal and thus shading is not present. 4. Analyses - To investigate statistical differences in shading when contracts are rigid versus flexible, I employ a series of two-tailed Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests to test whether shading is significantly more frequent under rigid contracts than under flexible contracts. This non-parametric test allows me to circumvent the assumptions that a parametric test would make about the distribution of the outcome variable, while also testing whether the means are significantly different in either direction (two-tailed test). I then complement this analysis by running two Logistic regression models to ensure the robustness of my findings. 4.1. Assumptions - Given that pairs of buyers and sellers are recreated randomly within each period in the study, and that players could only participate in one session of the study, I assume that all interactions are independent of each other. Still, the number of periods may affect play, which is why I include period as a control variable when conducting robustness checks (see model b). Analyses will test for both unconditional differences (Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests and regression model a) and for conditional differences when a few control variables are accounted for in each model (regression model b). Regression models employed to check for robustness of findings employ Logistic regression, given the binary nature of the outcome variable. 5. Results -  Based on the effect expressed by the claim, I expect to find significant lower shading associated with rigid contracts (compared to flexible contracts), proxied by less frequent low quality under rigid contracts. To test the hypothesis, I begin by looking at the entire dataset. I find that low quality is less frequent under rigid contract than under flexible contracts (9.1% vs 21.7%). This difference is significant based on a two-tailed Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (p<0.001), which lends support to the claim that shading is less frequent under rigid contracts. This holds true when only looking at participants in the baseline treatment (6.3% vs 26.0%; p<0.001), as well as only at those in the reduced flexibility treatment (4.6% vs 16.5%; p<0.001), while the difference is not significant when looking solely at participants in the no competition treatment (16.4% vs 20.6%; p=0.15), suggesting that there is no significant difference in shading when competition is absent (proxied by the random generation of contract terms in the experiment). These results are confirmed by a Logit regression (model a). Furthermore, results still hold true when controlling for period, price, state of nature (model b).",Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test,520275,1965,N/A,p-value,0,"Results show support for the claim that less shading occurs under rigid contracts than under flexible contracts. This is driven by the fact that significantly less shading occurs under rigid contracts when these are negotiated under competitive conditions, even when the extent to which flexible contracts are deemed flexible varies. However, this difference is no longer significant when competition is absent, as shading significantly increases under rigid contracts when contract terms are generated randomly (rather than competitively determined).",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",7,427

Also, I recoded all municipality codes from the individual countries so that each municipality has a unique ID. For preparation, I first coded all original variables used as was done by Bateson (2012). The dependent variable (protest participation) measured on a two-point scale was recoded to zero (no participation) and one (participation). The main independent variable asked about whether the respondent was a victim of crime during the past year as a dummy with one indicating “yes”. I also included the degree of urbanization (five-point scale from “rural area” to “national capital”), sex (one equals male), perception of personal economic situation (five-point scale from very bad to very good), and age in years along with age squared. In addition, I further added political interest (four-point scale from not interested to very interested), life satisfaction (four-point scale from very dissatisfied to very satisfied), and trust in people (four-point scale not confident to very confident). For a final robustness check, I also included personality traits as measured by the ten-item personality inventory (ten items, measured similarly to https://gosling.psy.utexas.edu/scales-weve-developed/ten-item-personality-measure-tipi/ten-item-personality-inventory-tipi/).

I did so, to establish a baseline as to whether the claim holds under the most similar circumstances.

Finally, I used multilevel models to test the claim, as this better fits the hierarchical structure of the data (original author used linear regression).

The outcome variable is the change in opinions. The logarithm of this variable was used due to the data being right-skewed. The predictor variable was the average level of rationa justification. 

A zero-inflated gamma linear mixed effects model was used, with individuals nested in their discussion groups. This model was used because the data is heavily biased with the presence of many zero observations, which zero-inflated models are situated to deal with. However, there is (to my knowledge) limited discussion in the literature regarding the appropriate assumption checks that are required for this model.

While the original study used a large number of control variables, the authors indicate that these are speculative and ""could in principle"" affect the outcome variable without any justification. These control variables were not included in the model for the current analysis. A check for outliers (greater than 1.5 IQRs from the median) was conducted, and while one value exceeded this threshold the analysis proceeded with this variable included on the assumption that the obsreved value was not a data input error.

The requirements of task 2 indicated that a single test was required to reach a decision about the hypothesis. The analysis used results in two analytical outcomes: an attempt to determine whether or not opinions changed (regardless of magnitude) and an attempt to determine the magnitude of opinion change for all participants whose decisions showed some change. The latter was taken as the test of the hypothesis, which states ""participants change their opinions more often when rational justification is used in the discussions”. The phrasing ""more often"" implies that magnitude of opinion change is the more direct measure of the hypothesis.

Tax and other concessions given to attract the project
The wages paid by the FDI project's company

Respondents were shown four pairs of projects (8 in total), with the attributes taken on by the project fully randomized.  For our purposes, we are primarily interested in the industry of the project (service-sector, labor-intensive, high-tech, and financial) and the expected impact on the job market (negative impact, no impact, or will create around 1000 jobs).  The remaining attributes are not of direct interest, though we control for these attributes in all analysis. 

The total sample size available for analysis was 2846 respondents, who evaluated a total of 22768 projects.  Each project was assigned a 1-7 point rating (where higher is better) and respondents were also asked to choose from among the two projects in the pair, producing a binary choice of yes/no for each project. 

A number of respondent-level characteristics are included in the data, but we focus on just two for discussion. The first is a binary indicator of college education, which we use as a proxy for low-skilled versus high-skilled labor. The second is information regarding the respondent's occupational sector, which indicates whether they are in the manufacturing or service sectors, or neither.

Data cleaning and coding was minimal, as many of the key variables for analysis had already been coded. This was a limitation of our replication attempt, as we were unable to fully explore alternate codings of respondent skill level or education level, for instance.  Data coding primarily consisted of checking the unique IDs, verifying the expected sample size for the main sample and subsamples, and identifying cases in which the respondent stood to gain from the project's labor market benefits, a point we explain in greater detail below.

Our goal in Task 2 was to evaluate the following hypothesis: Citizens are concerned about FDI projects’ impact on the local job market (when forming their preferences). We interpret this hypothesis as asking whether respondents consider the labor market impact in the aggregate, without reference to whether they personally benefit from increased demand for their labor or factor endowment. This is an important point, because respondents may care about the labor market effects due to the potential wage benefits that will accrue to them personally. In our analysis, we are careful to rule out this possibility. Prior to our main model -- for which we report results elsewhere in this form -- we conducted extensive analysis to ensure that the treatment effects of the ""positive labor market effect"" and ""negative labor market effect"" primes did not vary systematically as a function of the respondent's potential to benefit directly from increased demand for labor. 

This preliminary analysis consisted of classifying respondent-project pairs according to the potential for the respondent to benefit from the project as described. Low-skilled respondents working in the same sector (service or manufacturing/labor-intensive) as the proposed project may directly benefit from increased demand for their labor. In contrast, low-skilled workers are classified as receiving no benefit from projects in the high-tech or financial sector, and high-skilled workers reciee no benefit from projects in the manufacturing or service sectors. A middle category -- those who might indirectly benefit through a generalized increase in demand for their factor endowment, but not within their specific sector -- includes low-skilled workers in a different sector from a labor-intensive proposed project and high-skilled workers when paired with a labor-intensive or service-sector project.

Our goal was to check whether the potential for direct personal labor market benefits was associated with an increased treatment effect for the positive or negative labor market impact primes. Using OLS, we estimated a model predicting positive ratings (on a 7-point scale) of a given project, controlling for the project's attributes and respondent characteristics in the same manner as our primary analysis below. Interacting the treatment variable capturing expected labor market impact with a 3-level variable representing the potential direct, indirect, or null personal benefit a respondent might receive from the project allowed us to test for differences in the treatment effect of the ""+1000 jobs"" prime across the three subgroups. There was no evidence that increased potential for direct personal benefit increased the impact of the prime.  Similarly, there was no evidence for heterogeneous effects of the ""negative impact on the local labor market"" prime across these groups. 

The preliminary analysis allowed us to eliminate the possibility that the observed treatment effects for the positive/negative labor market impact primes were driven by respondents' personal ties to the sector/factor affected and the potential to benefit directly, on a personal level. As a result, we concluded that a direct and simple test of the hypothesis was possible, without attempting to separate the ""personal benefit"" effect from the ""labor market impact"" effect, as the former appeared to be absent in a statistical sense and qualitatively.

To assess the hypothesis that individuals base their preferences for FDI projects, in part, on the potential for the project to benefit the local labor market, we estimated a linear model predicting ratings for a given project. All possible attribute values were included as control variables, alongside controls for college education, gender, party membership, and region, among others.  Our interest is the difference in support for an FDI project between those described as:

A. Expected to create 1000+ jobs or
B. Expected to have no impact on the local labor market.

While included in the model, projects that were expected to have a negative impact on the local labor market are irrelevant to our calculations and the hypothesis test, because we also included a binary indicator for receipt of the prime ""negative expected labor market impact"" (in other words, these projects are not part of the omitted reference group to which we compare projects with the ""1000+ jobs"" prime). Our test statistic is simply the regression coefficient associated with the binary treatment indicator, where treatment refers to receipt of the ""1000+ jobs"" prime. 

The result clearly shows that respondents base their support for FDI projects, in part, on the expected creation of jobs locally, i.e. their labor market effects. Relative to projects with no expected labor market benefits, those that are predicted to create 1000 or more jobs are rated 0.3 points higher on a 7-point scale. Accounting for clustering at the individual level, this result is statistically significant, with p < 0.001. Importantly, the result is not driven by the potential to personally benefit from job creation, because the effect holds across subgroups that have little or no link to the industry in which the project will take place. Therefore, this result strongly supports the notion that broad benefits to the local labor market shape FDI preferences.",t-statistic,0.298,22768,d.f. of the regression model: 2817,p-value,<0.001,"An expectation of positive labor market impacts (i.e. job creation) from an FDI project increases support for the project across respondents, regardless of their personal skill level or employment sector.",Same as claimed by the original study,No,Yes,10,437

your analysis should produce a single, main result in terms of statistical families of z-, t-, F-, or χ² tests (or their alternative or non-parametric versions).
You should use Dispute (whether a country initiated a militarized interstate dispute, in a given year) as a dependent variable instead of Force (that represents initiation of a MID that includes the use of armed force). You should not use the logarithmic value of the number of coup events in your analysis.

“You can use the variable: lcoupsum/coup events. What we meant is that you should not make further transformations to that variable.  With the instruction (that was not clear enough) we wanted to rule out the option of what the authors did in the ""Further Methodological Consideration"" section. ("" we use the weighted number of coup events that occurred in each country (transformed using the natural logarithm and lagged one year"")  
[…]”

DISCUSSION
H1: The likelihood of conflict involvement increases with the increase of the threats to political survival.

The paper tests two different hypotheses: H1a) in which the conflict involvement is defined in terms of the initiation of a Militarized Interstate Dispute, in the following Dispute; H1b) where conflict involvement is considered as the initiation of a Militarized Interstate Dispute by using military force, in the following Force. However, the dataset encompasses several variables that are candidate to be regarded as the dependent ones:

 dispute: ""Initiation of a MID""  
 originit: ""initiation of a new dispute/dispute initiation originator""  
 origforce: “force initiation originator”
 dispinit: “dispute initiator”
 forceinit: “force initiator”
 force2: “Initiation of a MID with use of force”

In the current analysis, originit has been applied for MID without the use of force, i.e. to answer the question highlighted in the task about Dispute, and origforce for a MID with the use of force. The choice has been taken on theoretical grounds, that is the necessity to include events in which the state under analyses have originate the MID. Moreover, the replication study indicates that these variables are the ones adopted as dependent variables by the authors.

 Main Variables
 lcoupsum: ""log weighted risk of a coup""
 dispute: ""Initiation of a MID""  
 originit: ""initiation of a new dispute""  
 lagforcend: ""end of a military dispute at t-2"" 
 nborder: ""number of the borders""
 lnumber: ""number of allies"" 
 rcoupbin: ""presence of a recent coup"" 
 rwar: ""presence of a recent war"" 
 forceend: ""end of a military dispute"" 
 llrgdpch: ""ogarithm of GDP at t-1"" 
 ethfrac: ""ethnic fractionalization""
 regconf: ""presence of a regional conflict"" 
 polity2l: ""the log lagged factor of democracy"" 
 cinc: ""the composite index of national capability""

Data Preprocessing
Given the dataset, several variables appear as not necessary:

1)	lagconfendparts, confendpthrui and confendparts are variables stemming from specific datasets cited by the authors, and might be implemented only for comparison;
2)	lagdisp is a lagged value of dispute initiation, which is not used in the following analysis;
3)	force2 is a dichotomic that includes also military operations that has not been initiated by the country (in contrast to forceinit).
4)	Llcoupsum that entails the log weighted risk of a coup lagged of one year. The variable is excluded in order to comply with the further instructions received.

Analysis
The request of the second task can be solved by implementing the most performing technique applied in  the first task, i.e. the two-stage probit least squares, which accounts for both the binary nature of Dispute and the endogeneity of the data available.

The model implements all the variables selected in the study, as performed in the Task 1. More precisely:
a)	The variables cinc, polity2l, llrgdpch, ethfrac, regconf are kept as instruments for both theoretical and statistical reasons. In point of fact, they appear in the covariance matrix to be highly correlated with lcoupsum but uncorrelated with originit;
b)	The variables nborder, lagforceend, lnumber are considered as regressor of originit for theoretical, and, in the case of lagforceend, statistical reasons.
c)	The variables rcoupbin, rwar, forceend are implemented as regressors of lcoupsum, on both theoretical and statistical grounds.

The technique has been built also by applying standard error correction. In the first estimation the endogenous regressor lcoupsum is positively correlated with originit (estimate: 2.95862) and significant (p-value: 0.00378). Llrgdpch, lagforceend and ethfrac are also significantly correlated with originit (p-value: 0.01642; 0.03413; 0.00918), the first two are positively correlated (estimate: 0.41720; 0.38768), while the third one negatively (estimate: -1.18586). However, standard error correction does affect all the previous significant estimates: lcoupsum, remains significant with a p-value of 0.04824491, llrgdpch and ethfrac, are slightly above the p-value threshold at 0.05 (p-value: 0.07754687; 0.06045578), while lagforceend is markedly not significant: (p-value: 0.13934659). 

Conclusion
The main conclusion of this analysis confirms the analytical choices made in the previous study on the implementation of a two-stage probit least square, by embracing the endogenously driven correlation between the risk of a dismissal of the government and the initiation of an international dispute. The model appears to be significant, as it is supported, among other indicators, by a value z = 2.896 that falls outside the interval [-1:960;+1:960]. Therefore, we can reasonably claim that, on the basis of our data and within the limits of the research, there is a correlation between the risk of a coup and initiation of a MID. Yet, the limits highlighted in the previous analysis about the presence of unavoidable multicollinearities among several variables still persist, which compels for further investigations.",z-statistic,2.896,798,NA,p-value,0.00378,"The main conclusion of this analysis confirms the analytical choices made in the previous study on the implementation of a two-stage probit least square, by embracing the endogenously driven correlation between the risk of a dismissal of the government and the initiation of an international dispute.

Analysis for Hypothesis Testing

Menaldo (2016) claimed that “….after controlling for the profit potential implied by financial repression, as states grow weaker they increase the amount of credit directed to the government and SOEs” (p. 463). 
Therefore, in this reanalysis, I tested hypothesis that argues there is a negative relationship between state capacity and directed credit while controlling private credits. 

1.	I selected Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimators are most suitable for testing this hypothesis with this data. I used the “xtabond2” command for estimating Arellano-Bond z value.
2.	Second, for testing hypothesis, I included Private Credit (column privatecredit) to the GMM Model for controlling “the private potential implied by financial repression”. Results and the Stata command are shown below. The numbers of instruments were below the number of groups. Besides, the results of Arellano-Bond test for AR (2) and Hansen tests have no problem (n of obs = 2682; n of groups = 130; n of instruments = 83). According to the results, a negative relationship between state capacity and directed credits was significant if Private Credit was controlled (Coef = -6.05; SE = .77; z = -7.89; p < .001).

	( Preference(Group 1) > Preference(Group 2) ) | Unique Traits==negative 

As such, the results will support the tested claim if there is significant evidence that participants prefer the group that is presented as first over the group that is presented as second, but only if the traits that are unique to each group are negative. If the unique traits are positive then this claim does not postulate such preference. 

Therefore, only data from Experiment 1 from participants that had negative traits presented as unique was used to analyse this claim. Because the comparison between group preferences involves comparing frequencies, a Chi square test of goodness of fit was used – the distribution of participants’ choices was compared against the distribution representing the null hypothesis, i.e. that participants equally often preferred group 1 and group 2. 

DESIGN 
The experiment had one between-subject independent variable, which reflected whether unique traits characterizing two arbitrary groups were negative or positive. The dependent  variable was a binary choice: participants had to decide whether they prefer group that was presented first or second. To evaluate the tested claim only participants that were presented with unique negative traits were used.

RESULTS
The analysis was performed in R using RStudio (2022.07.2, build 576). 210 participants were tested in Experiment 1. 104 participants completed the task in the condition in which negative traits were unique.

The Chi square test for goodness of fit showed that if the unique traits were negative then participants were significantly more likely to prefer group 1 (65.4% for group 1; Chi2(1, N=104)=9.85, p=0.002).",Chi²-statistic,9.846,104,1,p-value,0.0017,"The results of the experiment support the claim.

In study 2, authors manipulated how much participants received attention from their partners in an experimental task, where participants and their hypothetical partners played a quiz game together. In the task, participants were asked to solve 20 quizzes and the partner made a choice of monitoring participants or doing nothing during. Participants could know whether the partner monitored them by the signal turning blue on. Significantly, participants believed monitoring them was nothing to do with the partner’s benefit. In the attention condition, the partner frequently monitored participants (in 16 out of 20 quizzes), and in the no attention condition, the partner did not monitor at all.

Only study 2a data was available, although study 2 consisted of three studies (2a, b, & c).

The authors excluded one participant suspected of using deceptive procedures. However, there is no mention of who was the one in the available data. Then, based on the statistical value (mean, SD, and correlation), I finally identified ID 20 as the excluded participant.

I examined the hypothesis (or the claim) using a hierarchical linear regression model with gender, condition, and impression of the partner predicting intimacy.

First, gender(0 = male, 1 = female) was entered because many aspects of social behavior are different between men and women, in general. There may be a difference in felt intimacy toward the partner (the partner’s gender was not revealed to the participants, and authors claimed gender had no significant effects at all, though).

Second, condition(0 = no attention, 1 = attention) was entered to examine the effect of manipulation on felt intimacy.

Third, the authors measured the impression of the partner with two items(“partner is a caring person / is kind”), and the impression score was available in the dataset, although they did not use it in the article. According to the hypothesis, the effect of attention on intimacy should not be attributed to the partner’s traits or personality. That is, perceived attention should increase intimacy with the partner regardless of impression of the partner. However, it is possible that participants increased their intimacy with their partner due to his/her traits(e.g., “my partner will understand me because s/he is a good person”). Thus, I added the impression score to control this effect.

I first entered gender and condition(model 1), then the impression score was entered(model 2). If the hypothesis is correct, condition is a significant predictor in model 1 and even in model 2 (i.e., the main effect of condition). I also entered the interaction between condition and impression(model 3). This is because it is possible that participant increases felt intimacy when their partner pays attention to them AND their partners seem to be good people. It does not matter if this interaction effect is significant.

However, it does matter if the main effect of condition disappeared after the interaction was entered because the hypothesis is only partially supported(attention from a partner increases felt intimacy only when the partner is a good person).

<RESULTS>
A hierarchical linear regression model was employed. Gender(0 = male, 1 = female) and condition(0 = no attention, 1 = attention) were coded, and impression and felt intimacy scores were standardized.

model 1: felt intimacy = gender + condition
model 2: felt intimacy = gender + condition + impression
model 3: felt intimacy = gender + condition + impression + condition*impression
If hypothesis is correct, the standardized partial regression coefficient of condition (0 = no attention, 1 = attention) is positive and statistically significant in model 1, and this positive and significant beta coefficient can be observed even in the model 2 & model 3.

The results showed that the beta coefficient of condition was positive and significant(B = 1.48, t = 5.80, p < .001) in model 1(adj.R^2 = .531). Gender did not predict felt intimacy in all models(|B|s < 0.14).

In model 2(adj.R^2 = .679), while impression predicted felt intimacy positively(B = 0.46, t = 3.60, p = .001), condition was still positive and significant predictor(B = 1.03., t = 4.19, p < .001), supporting the hypothesis.

Importantly, in model 3(adj.R^2 = .668), the interaction effect was not significant(B = -0.11., t = 0.28, p = .687).

The statistical hypothesis I tested is whether positive affect is significantly associated with healthier lipid profiles (higher levels of HDL-C) for Americans but not for Japanese.

Participants
The American sample consisted of a subset of participants from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) wave 2 (N = 1054) and MIDUS refresher (N = 746). The Japanese sample consisted of a subset of participants from the Midlife in Japan (MIDJA) wave 1 (N = 382) and wave 2 (N = 328).

Results
Culture was coded as a categorical variable with two levels (U.S. and Japan). The raw score of positive affect is the independent variable. HDL-C is the dependent variable. Linear regressions were run separately for each country because graphically the bivariate relationships look linear in each country. 

Among Americans, after controlling for age, gender, education, chronic conditions, cholesterol medication, and negative affect, positive affect was positively associated with HDL-C (b = 0.041, 95% CI = [0.010, 0.071], Cohen’s f2 = .005, t(1276) = 2.616, p < .001). The relationships remained significant without controls.

Among Japanese, after controlling for age, gender, education, chronic conditions, cholesterol medication, and negative affect, positive affect was insignificantly associated with HDL-C (b = -0.019, 95% CI = [-0.055, 0.016], Cohen’s f2 = .002, t(665) = -1.070, p = .285). The relationships remained insignificant without controls.

Both R-files use the same data analysis. First, we excluded all time points prior to the last one for each participant, as we only needed to know their last data entry indicating their relationship status to engage in outcome analysis over time. Thus, we had one data point per participant. Notably, the control variable “cohabitation duration” still accounted for differing previous lengths of cohabitation. Next, due to the categorical outcome (relationships status with 3 categories: stay intact, marry, break up), we ran a multinominal regression with periods of data collection as predictors (five predictors: period 1995, period 2002, period 2006-2010, period 2011-2013, period 2013-2015). The sample size per period was for Nperiod1995= 376, Nperiod2002= 1094, Nperiod2010= 1150, Nperiod2013= 658, Nperiod2015= 685. The results of this analysis suggest that cohabitators in later years are less likely to get married than cohabitators in earlier years, with regression coefficients with regard to the reference group being positive for 1995 and 2002 and then becoming negative thereafter (b1995 = 0.672, b2002 = 0.277, b2010 = -0.444, b2013 = -0.575, b2015 = -0.313).
The pattern of results did not change much when adding the control variables age and cohabitation duration (b1995 = 0.578, b2002 = 0.302, b2010 = -0.582, b2013 = -0.653, b2015 = -0.367, bAge = -0.038, bCohab = 0.046).
Next, we used these estimates (from the model including the control variables) to test our hypothesis of significant change of regression coefficients over time. In other words, does the likelihood of marriage of cohabitating individuals in relationships change over time. For that we also added a new variable “Year” to see if time predicted the change in our estimates. 
The F-statistic was significant supporting our hypothesis that marriage in later years becomes less likely (F (1,3) = 12.86, p = 0.03713, R2 = 0.7478). This is based on a two-tailed test, which is a conservative test in this case, and it was still significant (we could have used a one-tailed test here because we had a hypothesis about the direction of the effect, i.e., decrease in likelihood of getting married). The degrees of freedom for this model are df = 3. 
Note that, for the periods spanning several years, we used the median year to represent the time span (e.g., period of 2006-2010 was represented by 2008).

The independent variables included whether the k6lag (i.e., the six nearest neighbors’ average presence of overseas voting) changed during the previous two years (i.e., k6delta), whether the country was part of the British Empire (i.e., colbrit), French Empire (i.e., colfren), or Spanish Empire (i.e., colspan), whether English was the legal origin (i.e., legengl), natural log transformed GDP (i.e., lngdp), the natural log transform of the population size (i.e., lnpop), and the natural log transform of the Polity IV's 'Durable' measure (i.e., lndur).

To test this hypotheses, I conducted a logistic regression where the dependent variable is the onset of war between a dyad within five years of a militarized interstate dispute or MID (cow5yrwi: 0 = no war, 1 = onset of war) and the primary independent variables are the existence of a territorial MID (territor: 0 = no, 1 = yes) and whether the dyad is ""mixed regime,"" meaning it consists of one democracy and one nondemocratic state (mixed: 0 = no, 1 = yes). I also included control variables for the power distribution between states (caprat: ratio of weaker state capability to stronger state capability), the repetition of territorial disputes over time (terrcount: count of territorial disputes), whether dyads are jointly democratic (jtdem: 0 = no, 1 = yes), and whether the states in a dyad are rivals (rival: 0 = no, 1 = yes). Additionally, I interact territorial MID with mixed regime. A total of 2,788 dyads were analyzed. 

The logistic regression model provides a significant fit to the data, as indicated by the chi-squared value (210.78, df = 7, p < .001). Other indicators of fit include McFadden R-square = .088, AIC = 2206.2, and AUC = .702. Among the control variables, two fell short of significance at the traditional 95% level (caprat: B = .388, z = 1.943, p = .052; rival: B = -.224, z = -1.809, p = .070) while the others achieved significance (terrcount: B = .022, z = 2.402, p = .016; jtdem: B = -3.89, z = -3.870, p < .001). 

Consistent with Hypothesis 1, the effect of territorial MID is positive and significant (territor: B = .738, z = 4.925, p < .001), as is the interaction of territorial MID add mixed regime (territory*mixed: B = .769, z = 3.489, p < .001).

Psychological well-being: The authors calculated a variable for well-being by taking the mean score of 8 well-being questions from the
ESS dataset used by them. The scale ranges from 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating a higher well-being. I
used the calculated variable by the authors in the current analysis. See Figure 1. Reported statistics are on a
subset of the data only containing those who are marked as “male” in the data set.

Childlessness: The authors used three categories of “Parental status”: childless, currently living with children, and having
children that do not live with them anymore. From the introduction, I could not find a clear theoretical
reason to distinguish parents with children at home from parents without children at home, so I did not
distinguish between them. Instead, I used the question whether participants had ever given birth to or
fathered a child to create a variable “parent”, for which those who said “yes” were coded as “parent”, and
those who said “no” as “childless”. Find a histogram of childlessness in Figure 2. Reported statistics are all
on a subset of the data only containing those who are marked as “male” in the data set.

Tolerant norms towards childlessness:  To create an indication of tolerance towards childlessness per country, I used a question about approval
of someone’s choice to never have children, which participants answered as a score of 1 to 5, where 1 was
strongly disapproving and 5 was strongly approving. I calculated a mean this score per country to create in indication of tolerance towards childlessness. This was calculated over all participants, meaning both men
and women.

I conducted a linear mixed model using the function “lmer” from the package “lme4” (Bates et al. 2022), and
p-value calculation from the package “afex” (Singmann et al. 2022), with parental status (parent / childless),
tolerance of childlessness (1 - 5), and an interaction of those two terms as fixed effects, wellbeing (0 - 3) as the
dependent variable, and a random slope of parental status with a random intercept of country (24 countries).
I used sum-to-zero contrasts, with “parent” being coded as -1 (the reference category) and “childless” being
coded as 1. 95% confidence intervals of estimates were calculated using the function “tidy” from the package
“broom.mixed” and visualized using the function “ggplot” from the package “ggplot2” (Wickham et al. 2022).
The model showed a significant negative main effect of parental status on well-being, meaning childless men
scored lower on well-being than men who are parents (beta = -0.14(SE = 0.04, confint = [-0.22, -0.06]),
t(26.21) = -3.45, p =0.002). There was a significant positive main effect of tolerance of childlessness on
well-being, meaning men in countries with a higher mean tolerance of childless scored higher on well-being
(beta = 0.27(SE = 0.04, confint = [0.19, 0.34]), t(22.84) = 7.32, p <.001).

The level of concessions offered by the states was coded in the data as a categorical through four levels (0-3). The least cooperative type of bargaining behavior (category 0) is characterized by tactics designed to extract concessions from other states. Categories 1-3 then included increasing level of concessions, with category 3 being the most cooperative type of concession offers. This variable therefore was used as the depenedent variable through an ordinal logistic regression analysis to test the claim. The main independent variable was on the difference of values over which different states are bargaining. The data included a proxy on issue linkage structure, which measures the average zone of agreement between two states, and where the larger value indicates more difference in valuation of issues in the respective negotiation. the size of the state was controlled for through the GDP control variable. Due to large differences between countries, a natural logarithmic transform of GDP was used a the control variable.

SPSS 26 Software was used to test the claim (hypothesis). Correlation between the main variables was firs tested via Spearman´s correlation and it was found positive (0.53)  and statistically highly significant (p<0.01) between the dependent bariable and main independent variable.

Data Source and Variables
I chose to reanalyze the data using R (version 4.1.3), using the data of the file ChoicePanel2.dta as per the instruction. The data included 729 prospective adoptive parents (PAPs, as indicated by the identifier variable “pap_id”) and 839 birth mothers (BMOs, identified by “mother_id”), to whom applications for their child could have been sent.
The original paper's authors analyzed PAPs preferences for children who were up for adoption based on several characteristics—mainly race and gender of the child. They operationalized the preferences based on whether PAPs applied for a given child or not. The outcome variable was, therefore, the dichotomous variable “bid_on_d”, indicating that PAPs sent an application for a specific child (86242 bids for individual children were noted, they were coded as 1; whereas 1666182 entries were coded as 0 or “PAPs did not apply for this child”).
The authors then used several characteristics of the child as predictors of applications:
For example, if the child was a Black girl (variable “black_girl”), this variable was coded from 0 = not a Black girl to 1 = Black descent. In addition, the authors chose to use a continuous scale for all variables pertaining to race “to account for children of mixed descent (e.g., a child with a Caucasian father and an African American mother is classified as 0.5 Caucasian and 0.5 African American” (p. 142). The variable “black_girl” and the following variables range from 0–1 in several steps (i.e., 0.125, 0.333, and so on) to depict the mixed descent of the parents or BMO. The variable “black_boy” was handled identically, and so was “nonaa_girl”, with 1 being Caucasian girls. 
Analyses
The data were reanalyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects logistic regression models. I used the package lme4 version 1.1-30 (Bates et al., 2015), and its function glmer. These models allow the modeling of a dichotomous outcome while handling the nested (repeated) values, i.e., PAPs who potentially applied for more than one child. PAPs were included as random intercepts to account for the data structure. The models included the characteristics as predictors (black_boy, black_girl, nonaa_boy, and nonaa_girl) as log ORs due to the logit link of the models. Then, estimates (log ORs) were exponentiated to obtain odds ratios (ORs).
The original study's authors analyzed the PAP’s preferences twice: Once within an activity frame, i.e., within 10 days of the PAP’s first application, and once without any time restrictions regarding the application period. If the data support the hypotheses, effects should be found regardless of the application period (i.e., PAP’s preferences should be stable). For task 2, the direct replication was done, that is, only within 10 days’ activity.
Results
Hypothesis: “There are significant preferences favoring girls and against African American children put up for adoption”.
Generalized linear mixed-effects logit models concluded that the effect of black_girl was OR = 0.73 (95% CIs: 0.72–0.76, p < .001), the effect of black_boy was was OR = 0.57 (95% CIs: 0.56–0.59, p < .001), the effect for nonaa_girl was OR = 1.75 (95% CIs: 1.71–1.79, p < .001), and the effect for nonaa_boy was OR = 1.35 (95% CIs: 1.32–1.37, p < .001).
In other words, if a girl in the adaption ad was Black, the odds of PAPs applying were reduced by approximately 27%. Similarly, if the child was a Black boy, the odds of applying were reduced by 43%. On the other hand, if the girl was of White or Hispanic descent (the “non-AA” category), the odds of applying were higher (by 75%). Similarly, if the child was a boy of White or Hispanic descent, the odds of applying were 35% higher.

We could, therefore, conclude that based on the data, prospective adoptive parents favored girls more than boys as they applied for them with a higher probability. Furthermore, race played a role, as prospective adoptive parents disfavored Black children, boys more so than girls. With my reanalysis, I believe that the claim of the paper is supported.

2022-11-11T17:56:42Z,25N5D,Einstein_AmJourPoliSci_2017_mxyQ,R,"I first applied the following cleaning steps to the raw data: (1) created a flag for observations missing information about a response (23 observations out of the full sample), (2) used the treatment group variable to code the observations (emails requesting help) as black, white, or hispanic (roughly evenly split), (3) coded an indicator for whether the PHA official responded or not, and (4) coded three categories of the PHA official using a proper name in their response: (1) official responded and uses a proper name; (2) official responded and doesn't use a proper name; (3) official didnt respond so we dont know whether or not they would have used a proper name. Excluding the 23 emailers missing a response status leads to N = 991 observations.

The analysis is focused on the question: are housing officials more or less likely to greet Hispanic emailers by name compared to white emailers? Yet answering this question is complicated by the fact that (1) the signaled race affects any response and (2) we only know whether a proper name was used in the reply for officials who responded and do not know, among the officials who did not respond, whether or not they would have used a proper name. 

Therefore, following one of the recommended strategies in Coppock (2019), I redefine the estimand of interest as either: (1) responds and uses a proper name; (2) does not respond OR responds but doesn't use a proper name. This thus retains all 991 observations. I then use a chi-squared test to examine the following null and alternative hypotheses:

Null hypothesis: there is no relationship between hispanic vs. white race and whether the PHA official uses a proper name
Alternative hypothesis: there is a relationship between hispanic vs. white race and whether the PHA official uses a proper name

The chi-squared test statistic value is 13.683, which corresponds to a p value of p = 0.0002.

Hypothesis: There is a negative relationship between age and entrepreneurship rate. 
The above stated hypothesis was tested using all countries (OECD & none OECD countries) and without the inclusion of control variables. Knowing that using the supplied data by Liang et al. (2018) [cleaned and aggregated data from multiple sources] increases the likelihood of arriving at identical results, an effort is made by reproducing the results from two sources:- (1) Original raw data from global entrepreneurship monitor, and 2)the cleaned data that was supplied by the authors (Liang et al., 2018).  The following section explains the results of Data A (using original data from global entrepreneurship monitor). 
A.	Data A (using original data from global entrepreneurship monitor)
•	The following section elaborates how IV (age) and DV (entrepreneurship rate) were measured. Different approaches were used to measure age. Age is an independent variable measured as a continuous variable in one approach, dichotomous (young & old)  in another step, and polytomous (three categories: young, middle, old) in other instances. 
•	The original variables related to DV (the Entrepreneurship rate) from APS Global Individual Level Data are  dichotomous variables (Yes = 1, No = 0). DVs that were tested included
o	[suboanw] 'Actively involved in start-up effort, owner, no wages yet'
o	[babybuso] 'Manages and owns a business that is up to 42 months old' 
o	[teayy] 'Involved in Total early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity'
•	The initial analysis was to test whether age is related to Entrepreneurship. Since the variables are dichotomous, tetrachoric correlation was used and Age variable was dichotomized to be able to run tetrachoric correlation. 10 files were downloaded from https://www.gemconsortium.org/data/sets?id=aps
•	These files covered 2001 to 2010 and SPSS was used to merge the 10 files by adding cases. The single merged file is called '2001-2010.SAV'. The final used Sample Size was   N = 1,365,574. Tetrachoric correlation suggests that increase in age, decreases in business formation, suboanw (r = -.14), bbybs (r = -.14), and in Total early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity tea (r = -.16)
•	I have also used Machine learning applications to test the postulated claim. Using tidymodels and caret packages in R, I run logistic regression. I classified the dataset into training (80%, N = 1,065,220) and testing data (20%, N = 266,305). 
•	The results of logistic regression indicated that younger nations (people) are more likely to form new businesses than older people. The relationship between age and forming a business [Actively involved in start-up effort, owner, no wages yet] is negative and significant, (β = -0.022, p < .001).  The accuracy of predicting forming a new business is 0.958 based on the machine learning model with F_meas of 0.9787543 and a statistically significant negative relationship. I also found consistent results with different defenitions of entrepreneurship rate such as teayy ['Involved in Total early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity'] (β = -.023, p < .001).  , and babybuso ['Manages and owns a business that is up to 42 months old] (β = -.022, p < .001). The next section explains the results of Data B (the cleaned data that was supplied by the authors (Liang et al., 2018)).

B.	Data B (the cleaned data that was supplied by the authors (Liang et al., 2018))
•	The entrepreneurship rate was measured based on different definitions, and all definitions were tested, such a “entre_wage: New business less than 42 months and pay wages”, “entre_shd: entre_wage + shut down business in the past 12 months”; “entre_nwage: New business less than 42 months but do NOT pay wages”,” entre_ttl: New business less than 42 months, regardless whether pay wages or no”, “entre_ha5: entre_wage and plan to hire more than 5 employees in the next 10 yea”, “entre_ha10: entre_wage and plan to hire more than 10 employees in the next 10 ye”. We used ‘medage_20_64’ as an age variable, but results were consistent with average age as well. 
•	Using sample size of N = 17,554 along with regression line, I found consistent results when I replicated the analysis based on the data supplied by the authors Liang et al. (2018). The median age is negatively related to forming a new business (β = -.0072, p < .001) with an effect size of R2 = .16, F(1, 17552) = 3367, p < .001 when entrepreneurship rate was measured using ‘New business less than 42 months and pay wages’, entre_wage.
•	Consistent results were found when entrepreneurship rate was measured using entre_nwage: New business less than 42 months but do NOT pay wages, β = -.008, p < .001) with an effect size of R2 = .14, F(1, 17552) = 2978, p < .001.

    1. I manually recoded the original database (using LibreOffice Calc). The original format of dataset (“Study 2 Data September 2015.csv”), displays the dependent variables (11 items) in separate columns for each of the experimental groups, so that we can see 4 separate sets of 11 items. As far as I deduced, the name of the variable indicated the experimental condition – the variable named ‘M_NG_19’ contain the answers for item “19”, if participants was assigned to condition with male protagonist (“M”) who exhibited non-green (“NG”) behaviour. If the participants was assigned to other group, the cell in the column in empty.
I recoded that data (“Study 2 Data_transformed.csv”), so that there was only one set of dependent variables (11 columns) and two additional variables: “Male_Female” (values: “Male”, “Female”) and “Green_Nongreen” (values: “Green”, “Nongreen”), to indicate to which combination of conditions the participant was assigned to. 
    2. I imported the database “Study 2 Data_transformed.csv” into JASP (v. 0.16.4), creating the file “Independent”
    3. In JASP, I computed two additional variables: “Masculinity_index” and “Femininity_index” by averaging the score of three items pertaining to masculinity and femininity as described in the paper – I identified masculinity items as “V27”, “V28” and “V32” and femininity items as “V25”, “V26” and “V33”. 
    4. In JASP, I conducted Principle Component Analysis, following the description from the paper. I obtained the same results as authors.

The same dataset was used as for Task1. 
As for Task 1, the mean score for the positive affect variable and for the negative affect variables were computed. The variables of interest  which were not normally distributed were log-transformed.
After inspection of the dataset, it appears that individuals taking medication prescribed to lower their cholesterol level were included in the original article. This concerns about 23% of the American sample and 9% of the Japanese sample. Looking at the distribution of HDL-C, its level was indeed lower in medicated participants than non-medicated participants. As the cholesterol level is the dependent variable and used as an indicator of health, cholesterol medication should have been a factor of exclusion. Participants who reported taking cholesterol medicine or who failed to report their medication status were excluded.
       
Analyses
All analyses were performed with R. 
The analysis was ran on a dataset of 667 American and 328 Japanese participants. To test the effect of positive affect on blood lipids, standard and Bayesian linear regressions were ran. HDL-C was used as dependant variables, mean value for positive affect and country as predictor  variables, and age, education level, gender negative affect, the history of heart disease, hypertension, stroke and diabetes as control variable.

Results
The effect of positive affect on HDL-C in the American sample was not significant (t = 1.662, β = 0.107, p = .067); the Bayes factor was in inconclusive (BF = 0.536) in the American sample as well as in the Japanese sample (BF = 0.878) .  The interaction between positive affect and country for HDL-C was significant (t = -2.457, β = -0.223, p = .014), however the Bayes Factor was inconclusive (BF = 2.187).

Conclusion
After controlling for the occurrence of four health factors, the analysis did not reveal any conclusive relationship between positive affects and blood lipid levels, neither in the American population, not in the Japanese population. Although traditional inferential statistics pointed toward a significantly stronger relationship for the American than the Japanese sample, the Bayesian factor analysis was inconclusive.",t-statistic,1.662,995,978,Bayes factor,0.536,"After controlling for the occurrence of four health factors, the analysis did not reveal any conclusive relationship between positive affects and blood lipid levels, neither in the American population, not in the Japanese population.",Opposite as claimed by the original study,No,Yes,0,479
2022-11-24T02:09:25Z,0OQ4O,Fitzgerald_SocialForces_2018_4q0L,"R, Python, Stan","The relationship between state-level carbon emissions (CE; measured in million metric tons) and average working hours (AWH) was assessed by comparing multilevel bootstrap estimates of the AWH coefficient against a null model.

Preprocessing:
This analysis made use of the preprocessed control variable data provided in ""Processed files/compiled.dta"" by the replication team (Cheng and Mallinson). Average household size data was obtained from IPUMS following the instructions provided by the replication team in ""Script/README.txt"". The IPUMS data could not be retrieved with PERWT weightings (the number of people represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample) of the NUMPREC variable (the number of person records associated with a household record), thus the NUMPREC data was stratified based on HHWT (the number of households represented by a IPUMS sample). First-order interaction covariates were calculated by taking the pair-wise product of every numerical variable, excluding AWH. The numerical variables were logarithmically transformed prior to model fitting.

Model:
To assess the relationship between CE and AWH, I generated estimates of the elasticity of AWH using two bootstrap procedures, which are described below. The same regression model was used to fit the data from the two bootstrap procedures. The regression model used first-order autoregressive and moving average predictors (ARMA), and partial pooling with varying intercepts for the identity of the States and the year of measurement. AWH was included as a main effect and was not included as an interaction term. All other numerical covariates where included as main effects and as an interaction with every other covariate aside from AWH. These covariates were annual state-level metrics of: population, average household size, percentage of the population that was working-aged (15 to 64), percentage of the population that was employed, labor productivity (GDP per hours worked), percentage of the GDP derived from manufacturing, and energy production (in billion BTU).

Priors:
The prior distribution on the autoregression and moving average coefficients were unit normal. Priors on the beta coefficients were normal with mean zero and standard deviation of 0.5. The group-level standard deviations of the normal priors for the State-level and year-level intercepts were sampled from Half Student's t distributions with location zero, scale 2.5 and dof 3. The standard deviation of the shared residual variance was sampled from a Half Student's t distribution with the same parameterization. The prior for the grand intercept was a Student's t distribution centered on the grand mean of the response variable (the logarithmically transformed CE of the training data) with scale 2.5 and dof 3. A non-centered parameterization of the model was fit using LBFGS to find the penalized maximum likelihood estimate of the joint parameters.

Bootstrap procedure:
The H1 procedure generated bootstrap data by randomly sampling States with replacement, while preserving the timeseries within each state. Each sampled State timeseries was assigned a random State label (sampled without replacement), such that every bootstrapped dataset included 50 unique State labels.

The H0 procedure simulated data corresponding to the null hypothesis that AWH has no reliable relationship with CE. The H0 procedure sampled States with replacement in the same fashion as the H1 procedure. The H0 procedure additionally shuffled the AWH measures. Since the regression learns the relationship between AWH and CE with partial-pooling of State-level and year-level variance, the null model disrupts the covariance between State-level AWH and CE, and the temporal covariance between AWH and CE. Specifically, the log-transformed AWH measures of one bootstrapped State were exchanged with another bootstrapped State, and the AWH measures were shuffled within-State (resampled without replacement), but AWH measures were not mixed across States.

The bootstrap procedures were repeated (n=100) and the regression model was fit based on each dataset, which generated two distributions of AWH elasticity coefficients. 

Significance test:
The H1 distribution of AWH coefficients was compared with the H0 distribution of AWH coefficients using a Mann-Whitney U-test (a two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum exact test). The test indicated that the mean of the H1 distribution was significantly greater than the H0 distribution (U = 13475.000, W+ = 8425.000, p < .001, Z = 8.369, n = 100 bootstrap iterations). The mean elasticity of AWH was 0.595 and 0.007 for the H1 distribution and the H0 distribution, respectively.

Approach:
This modeling approach affords several advantages. The variance in CE accounted for by AWH was estimated in the presence of multiple covariates (7 main effects and 21 first-order interaction effects). The covariates are used to partial out the variance explained by AWH, as the AWH coefficient has to outcompete these other regressors. The inclusion of these covariates is possible under a penalized maximum likelihood objective function. The bootstrap procedure relaxes parametric assumptions about the data sampling function, generating a distribution of AWH elasticity estimates for the observed data, and also a distribution of AWH estimates for a null model. The null model specifically disrupts the relationship of interest, but is statistically matched to the mean at the hypothesis-relevant levels. The bootstrapping procedure also makes the inference less dependent on the data-generating hypothesis represented by the priors.

In Task 1, I used a Bayesian Multilevel Log-Log ARMA(1,1) regression model to estimate the Bayesian Credible Interval of AWH elasticity. To satisfy the requirements of Task 2, I used bootstrap resampling to estimate elasticity for the inferred population of measurement clusters (State units). Rather than comparing the AWH coefficient against the data generating process of the model, I simulated a statistically-matched null distribution.",Mann-Whitney U-test,13475.000,100,N/A,p-value,2.2e-16,"Over the 2007–2013 period, there is a significant positive relationship between state-level carbon emissions and average working hours.",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,Yes,30,480

The author's data preparation Stata script did not run well on the raw data, as the original data files referred in the Stata .do file were probably pre-processed and/or used previous releases of the data. Contextual variables (unemployment rate) were taken from the World Bank database rather than Eurostat.

The hypothesis I tested was that higher unemployment rates decrease non-materialist positive framings of the EU. Since the predictor was a contextual variable measured at country-year level, I collapsed the individual-level data to obtain a balanced panel dataset of 270 country-year cases (27 EU countries across 10 years). To account for country and year effects, I fit a two-way fixed effects panel model using the `plm` package (version 2.6.2) in `R`. The model predicted a small reduction of -0.0034 points
(c.i. = -0.0051 - -0.0017; t = -3.8531; s.e. = 0.0009) on the non-materialist positive EU framing scale (M=0.5; s.d.=0.07; mad=0.04) for a one-percentage-point positive difference in the unemployment rate.  

In Task 1 I fit a similar model, but which (1) used a scale for measuring positive EU framig which combined both materialist and non-materialist items, and (2) included year-on-year 'GDP growth' as an additional predictor. For Task 2, I changed the outcome scale to only measure non-materialist forms of framing and removed the 'GDP growth' predictor from the model. Removing the control for GDP growth reduces the effect size of 'unemployment' somewhat (in the Task 1 model the introduction of 'unemployment' removed the statistical significance of the 'GDP growth').

“Your analysis should produce a single, main result in terms of statistical families of z-, t-, F-, or χ² tests (or their alternative or non-parametric versions).
You should include unhappiness in your set of controls variables. You should focus on trust in parliament when estimating trust in politics in your analysis. You should not control for long-term country of immigration interaction with concern about immigration and popular far-right party interaction with concern about immigration in your analysis.”

The main hypotheses to be tested is: Concern about immigration is positively related to political distrust.

Hence, I use distrust in parliament as outcome variable (recoded, 0-10 where higher vlaues indicate lower trust) and include unhappiness (recoded, 0-10 where higher values indicate lower happiness) in analysis. No interactions were included. In terms of regression setup, I include individual-level and country-level control variables (Model 1). I included the following control variables: satisfaction with life, frequency of social meet-ups, social distrust, perceived income, satisfaction with own health, satisfaction with education system, satisfaction with government, left-right-scale, age, gender, education, income, voted for incumbent government, percentage radical right party at country level, rule of law indicator, GDP per capita, and unemployment rates.

For task 2, I reduced the analysis script to the one single analysis that I find the most appropriate to evaluate the claim made by Kuo and Raley (2016) that cohabitors have increasingly become less likely to proceed to marriage. To reiterate, the dataset that was provided on OSF contained data from five time periods: 1995, 2002, 2010, 2013, and 2015. In the Kuo and Raley paper, the periods 1995 and 2010 are compared to arrive at the claim that cohabitors have become less likely to progress to marriage. However, the data for 1995 in the OSF dataset seemed faulty, since there were only 4 marriages on record (in the paper 340 marriages were listed for 1995). I thus decided to exclude the 1995 data from the analysis. For task 1 I analyzed changes from 2002 to 2010, 2002 to 2013, and 2002 to 2015 with multinomial logistic regression (this is appropriate because the relationship status variable has three levels: intact cohabitation, breakup, married). In all analyses I arrived at the conclusion that the claim by Kuo and Raley was valid. For task 2 now, I decided to take the 2002-2015 model as the most relevant one, because it encompasses the largest timeframe and 2015 is the most recent data in the dataset.

I am not even sure what this means as documentation for this was not present, but this is the key subset used in the do file. Deviating from the authors, I converted the Polity scores into three categories (autocracies = 3, anocracies = 2, and democracies = 1) and looked at the subset of observations for which there are at least two ""encounters"" or ""opportunities"" for considering or launching an attack. The exact statistical hypothesis I tested is whether prior violent militarized conflict increases the salience of proliferation threat if the target is an autocracy relative to a democratic target. For Task 1, I estimated a saturated linear regression where the binary dependent variables are whether an attack was considered and whether an attack was launched and the two categorical regressors are the presence of a prior violent militarized conflict and the target's Polity score category. To test the hypothesis, I looked at the coefficient of the interaction term and calculated a t-statistic of 2.20 if the dependent variable is considered attack and a t-statistic of 2.26 if the dependent variable is actual attack.

In Task 2, national norm approving childlessness was grand-mean centered in the men-only sample. Age is group-mean centered in the men-only sample. Gender was excluded as a control variable because the sample includes only men.

- Task 2 sample selection: Men (not women) from all 25 countries who are over 40 years of age are included in the sample.

- Task 2 hypothesis testing: Consistent with the claim, I tested this hypothesis: The negative relationship between being childless and psychological well-being is moderated by national approving norm toward childlessness, such that the negative relationship is weaker in countries with higher approving norm toward childlessness. 

- Task 2 statistical procedure: The hypothesis is tested using a multilevel model in Mplus. The following multilevel model was run for the sample of men (not women) for Task 2. The model includes an individual-level (Level 1) effect of being childless on psychological well-being, with a random slope at level 2 (country level). The random slope depicts the variation of the effects of being childless on psychological well-being across different countries. In addition, the fixed effect of age on psychological wellbeing are also included as control variables at level 1. At the country-level (Level 2), national approving norm toward childlessness predicts both the random intercept of psychological wellbeing and the random slope described above. This is a suitable statistical procedure because a significant interaction of being childless and national norm for childless would be evident if national norm significantly predicts the random slope of being childless. This would suggest the variation of the effect of being childless across countries is accounted for by national norm approving childless.  Simple slopes are then computed to confirm the effects of being childless on psychological well-being in countries with higher (+1 SD) and lower norms (-1 SD) toward childlessness. 

- Task 2 Results of statistical tests: Among men, national norm approving childlessness does not interact with being childless (γ = .04, SE = .03, p = .188) in predicting psychological well-being, suggesting the effect of being childless on psychological well-being among men is not moderated by national norm approving childlessness.

You should use the general government consumption as a fraction of total consumption for measuring public spending.

Data and Methods
 
Dependent variable
In order to test the claim stated by the authors, the main dependent variable in the dataset is GOVCONS: which is general government consumption as a fraction of total consumption.


Independent variables
 
In the dataset, authors have used 4 variables to proxy for political polarization. These variables are taken from the World Values Surveys (WVS). They consider 4 questions which capture the preference of respondents for the size of the size of government. Although the authors have used 4 questions. I believe the most pertinent variables that capture preferences for the size of government are: (1) PRIVATE: whether government or private ownership of businesses should be increased and (2) GOV: the government should take more or less responsibility to ensure that everyone is provided for. These two variables PRIVATE and GOV are highly correlated (0.86). To compare the level of polarization, I have used the standard deviation of PRIVATE and GOV as the key measure of polarization. 

Control variables

I control for country response rate to each question in the survey as a control variable for both private ownership of businesses (PROPRESP_PRIVATE) and government responsibility (PROPRESP_GOV).

The claim is for the sub-sample of strong democracies. Using the Polity IV democracy index, 30 countries with a democracy score of 9 to 10 were classified as strong democracies. The sample for this examination was only for countries that were classified as having strong democracies.
 
I have used OLS regression model (reg in Stata) with robust standard errors to examine the claim. This is because the dependent variable is a numeric (float) variable. Also, since the number of observations of strong democracies is quite low (around 30), any attempt at using more causal models like Instrumental variable analyses would be quite weak and unsubstantial.

I use the variable “trust in the country’s parliament” as measurement for “trust in politics”, the dependent variable. Concretely, I use the reverse coded variable trstprl_r. Higher values on this variable indicate higher levels of distrust in the country’s parliament. 
The independent variable  is “concerns about the effect of immigration on the national community”. I measure this concept using three items: people from other countries being good/bad for the economy (imbgeco_r), people from other countries undermining/enriching country’s cultural life (imueclt_r), and people from other countries making country a worse/better place (imwbcnt_r). Higher values indicate more negative assessments of the effect of people come to live here from other countries. In order to test the goodness of fit of the measurement I calculate Cronbach’s alpha. I get α = 0. 8379 which confirms the internal consistency and reliability of the construct. 
For analyzing the hypothesized negative relationship between concerns about the effect of immigration on the national community and distrust in parliament and for fulfilling task 2, I conduct several multilevel regressions with time fixed effects, since the data is spatially and temporarily structured. 
In the first model (M1), I simply test the bivariate relationship between concerns about immigration and distrust in parliament. M1 detects a highly significant effect of concerns about immigration on distrust in parliament (b = 0.320, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001, z = 83.61, P>|z| = 0.000).
In the second model (M2), I include the in task 2 required control variable on the individual level: unhappiness (happy_r). The inclusion of the control variables leads to a slightly smaller regression coefficient of concerns about integration (b = 0.303, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001, z = 78.78, P>|z| = 0.000), which nevertheless remains highly significant. 
In order to account for other potentially confounding variables on the individual level, I include apart from unhappiness, the following individual-level control variables in the third model (M3): dissatisfaction with life, frequency of meeting friends, interpersonal distrust, dissatisfaction with the health care system, dissatisfaction with the education system, dissatisfaction with government performance, self-positioning on left-right scale, age, gender, and level of education. Moreover, I include country fixed effects in M3 to assess potential differences between countries. In this model, the regression coefficient of concerns about immigration is smaller than in M1 and M2, but still highly significant (b = 0.157, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001, z = 43.14, P>|z| = 0.000). 
In the fourth model (M4), which is the most restrictive one, I include country fixed effects, the same individual-level control variables as in M3 as well as the following control variables on the country level: expenditure on social protection, quality of governance, GDP per capita, and unemployment. In comparison to task 1, I excluded the country-level variables strong far-right presence and long-term history of immigration from the analysis. The regression coefficient of concerns about immigration in M4 is still highly significant (b = 0.157, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001, z = 43.14, P>|z| = 0.000) and equally high as in M3.

Accordingly, my analysis provides support for the tested claim “concerns about the effect of immigration on the national community have a(n) [reducing] impact on trust in politics. (p. 199)” by McLaren (2012), also with the inclusion of unhappiness as control variable, and with the exclusion of long-term country of immigration interaction with concern about immigration and popular far-right party interaction with concern about immigration from the analysis (as required by task 2).",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,Yes,10,504
2023-02-24T17:56:57Z,QIWQJ,Gartzke_JournConflictRes_2009_rym8,R,"I tested the hypothesis I was given: Nuclear-capable states are more likely to be recognized by other nations.
My analysis strategy was to first assess how well the data other than the possession of nuclear capabilities explain the variance in the recognition variable, then I assessed if the addition of the nuclear capabilities variable raises the explanatory power of the model. To achieve this, I employed a three-step approach.
First, given the large number of variables in the dataset (including categorical, ordinal, and scale-type variables with high redundancy), I conducted a factorial analysis of mixed data (FAMD) using the ""FactoMineR"" package in R. I included all variables, except those used as the outcome variable, those related to nuclear capabilities, and those intended for later use as random factors. This reduced the interpretability of my results, but since I was only interested in the effect of the possession of nuclear weapons, this was not a problem. Before conducting the factor analysis missing values were imputed using the “imputeFAMD” function from the “missMDA” R package. The criteria of success I determined for the factor analysis to be a viable solution was the extracted factors to explain at least 70% of the variance while ensuring that the smallest eigenvalue remained above 1. The analysis resulted in 22 factors.
Second, as I intended to investigate the predictive power of both the identified dimensions and their interactions, (253 terms in total), I decided to conduct an elastic net regression analysis to identify the most influential terms. Elastic net regression is a regularized regression method that combines the L1 and L2 penalties to achieve both variable selection and parameter estimation. The L1 penalty, also known as the Lasso penalty, encourages sparsity in the model by shrinking some of the coefficients to zero. The L2 penalty, also known as the Ridge penalty, encourages the coefficients to be small but does not force them to be exactly zero. The analysis was conducted using the R packages caret and glmnet. Due to the large size of the dataset, one set of five resampling iterations was performed. The 15 most influential predictors were selected based on the visual inspection of the importance scores.
Third, using the R package lme4, I conducted multiple multilevel binomial regression models to first evaluate the impact of the identified factors on the recognition variable. Variables were normalized using the BestNormalize package. Initially, I determined that the most fitting structure for the models would be the following: “~ (...) + (1|statea:dyadid) + (1|stateb:dyadid) + (1|year)”. “statea” being the country which might have the nuclear capability, “stateb” being the country that might recognise the other country, “dyadid” being the unique ID of each pair of countries, and “year” referring to the year of the potential interaction. However, as the models I tried to run did not converge, I simplified the model by removing the term with the “year” variable. The final model without nuclear capabilities included 13 fixed and two random factors. Following the identification of the best model I tested if the addition of the possession of nuclear capabilities raises the ratio of explained variance. The best model not containing the possession of nuclear capabilities had an AIC value of 132356 and BIC value of 132520.7, while adding the possession of nuclear capabilities (z = 6.116, p < .001, n1 = 209694, n2 = 9230, df.resid = 218907) had an AIC of 132320 and a BIC of 132495. Based on both the AIC and the BIC being smaller, as well as the possession of nuclear capabilities being a significant predictor, I conclude that the data support the original statement.
A limitation of my approach is that it does not account for temporal relationships.

In the present analyses, bimonthly mortality rates by US states were regressed on the number of days with temperatures above 90°F. To account for seasonal effects the regression included random effects for the month by year. Because the outcome refers to mortality rates, we estimated a mixed-effects Poisson regression. Preliminary analyses identified substantial oversdispersion. Therefore, the Poission regression included an additional oberservation-level random effect to account for the larger variance. The focal hypothesis was evaluated by comparing two regression models. A model that included the temperature indicator and a dummy variable representing the two time periods (0 = 1931-1959, 1 = 1960-2004) as predicator of mortality rates and another model that additionally included an interaction term between the temperature indicator and the time period.

#Paper Title: Contracts as Reference Points—Experimental Evidence
#Paper ID: Fehr_AmEcoRev_2011_gdlO
#Claim: ... under rigid contracts much less shading occurs [than under flexible contracts]. (p. 493.)
The sentence stems from the abstract of the paper, and the corresponding statistical analysis is presented on page 507:""Sellers provide normal quality in 94 percent of the cases in which the good state is realized. In flexible contracts, however,the higher prices are not always sufficient to prohibit sellers from shading. In the good state sellers provide normal quality in only 75 percent of the cases (see Table 2). The difference in the frequency of shading between the two contract types is statistically significant (nonparametric signed rank test, p-value=0.031 (one-sided)) and very stable over time (see Figure 1).""

The claim refers to shading, which is defined in the paper: ""Shading"" refers to behavior where sellers deliver lower quality, in the authors' words ""providing perfunctory rather than consummate performance"" (page 494). Practically, this means delivering lower quality (dichotomous decision of decision makers).
Important caveat: The claim that is to be evaluated refers to a correlational statement (i.e., it does not say, ""flexible contracts cause shading""). This is discussed in the original article at length and I am restricting my analysis to the correlational claim. This includes the possibility that endogeneous reasons cause economic actors to choose flexible contracts in the first place, in order to shade subsequently. The authors provide a lot of tests in this realm, but I restrict my re-analysis to the main (correlational) claim that was presented in the instructions.
Statistically, I did the following: 
Step 1: Here, I am loading the original data provided in OSF into R, using ""haven"", as the original data comes from Stata.The central claim refers to a statement made in the basic treatment, which is why I am using the ""condition = 1"" subsample. 
Step 2: I am quickly verifying that the dataset is correct, replicating the 50/50 split of contracts shown in Table 2 of the paper. This proofed correct.

Step 3: The claim about shading applies to cases where a contract is actually realized. Thus, I am subsetting the relevant data.
Step 4: I am observing the descriptive differences in shading behavior, by looking at how quality differs in contracts, now, as a critical feature of task 2, also accounting for costs (“good state”). The claim seems qualitatively supported.
Step 5: I am using a logistic regression for inference. I am ""quick and dirty"" recoding the quality variable in the regression (0/1 instead of 1/2)

> *Claim: ... tax treatment increased monitoring (p. 706.)*

Following the Task 2 instructions, I focus specifically on budget monitoring and I disregard the information treatment.



## Research Design

The paper reports an original experiment, which uses a block-randomized design, with four treatment groups and two block groups (canvasser and villages).

In the data, the independent variable is an indicator of whether the subject was assigned to the tax treatment or the windfall treatment. 

The data provide three relevant outcome variables, which come from survey items the subjects answered after receiving the treatment. The three items are listed below, with response options in parentheses. 

1. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement, ""You should pay more attention to what the district government does"" (on a scale of 1 to 4 where 1 is ‘strongly disagree’ and 4 is ‘strongly agree’)
2. How interested would you say you are in learning more about what the government of Blora is doing?  (1 Very interested; 2 A bit interested; 3 Not too interested; 4 Not interested at all)
3. Would you say you are in learning more in the future about how the district government spends money in the APBD? (1 Very interested; 2 A bit interested; 3 Not too interested; 4 Not interested at all)

Since the Task 2 instructions ask me to focus on budget monitoring, I use item 3 as my outcome variable since it is the only item to focus specifically on spending. 

According to the questionnaire, the same item was included in a pre-election wave. As best I can tell, however, that pre-election item is not included in the dataset available on the OSF. Therefore, I cannot examine within-subject variation and instead focus on between-subject analysis of the data.



## Randomization Inference

I rely on randomization inference because it accounts for the blocked random assignment in these data without the strong distributional assumptions required by asymptotic chi-squared tests or regression models.

Given the four-category outcome and two-category treatment, I use the chi-square as the test statistic. 

I rely on a sharp null of no treatment effect for all units.

I generate 10,000 randomizations of the data. In each randomization, the treatment vector is randomly shuffled within block groups (villages and canvassers), breaking the expected association between treatment and outcome. 

The p value indicates the proportion of randomizations for which the the chi-squared statistic exceeds the observed chi-square value. 

## Result

Subjects in the tax treatment were slightly more likely than those in the windfall treatment to indicate that they were at least a little interested in monitoring how their district government spends money. Specifically, 73% of those in the windfall treatment reported that they were ""a little interested"" and 2% reported they were ""very interested"", compared to 79% and 2% in the tax treatment. 

Though weak substantively, this relationship is unlikely to arise from chance alone;  the observed chi-squared statistic of 7.559 exceeds 97.1% of those found in the randomization distribution (p = 0.0288).",randomization inference based Chi²-statistic,7.559,1863,NA (randomization inference),p-value,0.0288,"Subjects in the tax treatment were slightly more likely than those in the windfall treatment to indicate that they were at least a little interested in monitoring how their district government spends money.

2023-02-27T23:25:24Z,456AG,Huijts_EurSocioRev_2013_OY3B,R,"Here I write an overview of the methods/analyses I used. All the preprocessing and analyses, with detailed descriptions and comments are reported in an R notebook (please check the notebook). I tested the claim “The disadvantage in psychological well-being of childless people is smaller in countries with tolerant norms towards childlessness”, for men (in task 2) and for women (in task 1). For this, I first preprocessed the ESS dataset to extract the key variables. I took the following steps for the preprocessing: 1) I combined the three ESS datasets, and applied the exclusion criteria as outlined in the paper (i.e., excluding Cyprus, only including respondents over 40). According to Note 2 in the paper, I also excluded people who declared to be the biological parent of at least one child, but also stated never to have lived with their child(ren). They also excluded respondents who stated that they once lived with their children, but that these children had left the parental home at the age of 18 or younger; however, I was not able to find this variable in neither the data_dictionary.xlsx file or the full ESS dataset (after checking the documentation for ESS), so I did not apply this criterion. According to note 2, these participants only make up 1.6 percent of the age-selected sample, therefore this should not alter the results significantly. 2) To find the parental status, I first found whether the respondent is currently living with child(ren) by looking at whether any of the rship2-15 variables are equal to 2. If so, the parental status is “Living-w-children”. For those who don’t currently live with a child, I looked at whether they have ever given birth to/fathered a child OR had children living in the household at some point. If so, then the parental status is “empty nest”, and otherwise “childless”. 3) I found psychological wellbeing by taking an unweighted average of the 8 measures of CES-D after appropriate recoding, and counted the number of missing items (later used as exclusion criterion). 4) I subtracted the minimum age (41) from the age variable, and found the squared of the age variable as well to include in the model later. 5) marital status was found by using the ‘maritala’, ‘lvghwa’ and ‘lvgptna’ variables as outlined in the paper. 6) individual and parental education were recoded as outlined in the paper as well. For parental education, the maximum of the father’s and the mother’s education is used. If only data from either father or mother was available, that is used as the parent’s education level. If both data for mother and father was missing, I introduced a new category ‘Missing’ as defined in the paper. 7) religious attendance, paid work, country of residence, individual’s approval of childlessness and individual’s level of social contact were all recoded as outlined in the paper. 8) Finally, I derived the country-level variables. Societal norms towards childless were found by finding the percentage of all respondents (from all ages, excluding Cyprus) who (strongly) disapproved of childlessness. The level of social contact was also found by taking the mean of individuals’ social contact (again from all ages, excluding Cyprus). These numbers exactly match the reported numbers in table 2 (replication). 9) After finding all the key variables, I excluded participants who were missing any information on the key variables that I included in the model later. I also excluded those who were missing five or more of the well-being measures. Note that in the paper they mentioned they performed “list-wise deletion of respondents with missing information”, however, no further information is provided on how this deletion was performed and which variables were used. As a result of this uncertainty, there was a mismatch between the final sample used in the paper and my final sample (I had ~1000 more participants). 10) The parental status, individual and parental education levels, marital status, paid work, born in country and gender were dummy coded with specified reference levels as the paper. Indeed, in the analyses I submitted for task 1, I included the results of the model for male respondents as well. So, here I'm just using a subset of my analyses to satisfy the requirements of task 2. For male respondents, the only significant interaction term in table 4 of the paper corresponds to model 2a, for Lives with children x Percent (strongly) disapproves: B = 0.002, SE = 0.001, P<0.05.

More specifically: sample size (11023): replicated; focal coefficient (B=0.002, se=0.001): replicated; degrees of freedom for interaction term = 43.9; focal p-value (P=0.008): replicated.

The dataset includes 1,008 elections in 27 countries between the years of 1945 and 2008.

MEASURES
Turnout. Turnout is measured as the percentage of registered voters that voted in a given election (Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, 2009).

Foreign Ownership. Four different measures of foreign economic ownership were used. The first indicator was net foreign direct investment (FDI) flow, which captured net FDI inflows into a country as a percentage of GDP. The second was FDI stock, which captured FDI assets and liabilities as a percentage of GDP in a given country in a given year. The third, portfolio equity stock, captures smaller-scale foreign investments into companies as a percentage of GDP (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007). Finally, trade captured exports and imports as a percentage of GDP. To deal with skewness, all variables were logged. A logged index of the raw measures was also taken as a composite measure of foreign ownership, as the indicators displayed fairly good reliability (α=.84). The index was lagged one year to ensure that foreign ownership was causally prior to turnout.

Controls. To control for all other confounders associated with countries and the associated time of the election, each model included country and year fixed effects (year of the election). To deal with time trend-specific heterogeneity (Kneip, Sickles, and Song 2012), I also control for country-specific time trends.

ANALYTIC STRATEGY
To test the ownership-constraint hypothesis (that foreign ownership reduces turnout), this analysis used the composite foreign ownership score as a key predictor. The model also contained contained country and year fixed effects and country-specific time trends. To adjust for reduced statistical power associated with having the same unit over time as opposed to completely independent units, the analysis also included standard errors clustered by country.

RESULTS
All else equal, there was no detectable association between the composite foreign ownership scale and a country's level of turnout (B=-1.59, SE=1.89, t=-0.84, p=.413).

It contains surveys administered to parents, teachers, and caregivers at 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15 years after a child's birth. The data sets contain up to 4027 variables, so one has to select (or calculate) the required variables.

The main study contains 19 independent variables, which have to be selected or calculated from the data sets (an exact description is missing in the paper; see R script). 

# Exact statistical hypothesis (model specification)

The claim to be tested was the following:
""Claim: ... conﬂicting reports [about who their child lived with] were much more likely when fathers spent nights with the mother (an indicator of part-time cohabitation)… (p. 73)""

Hence, the dependent variable (DV) was labeled ""discrepancy"" and turned 1 when parents had conflicting reports and 0 otherwise. The main variable of interest was ""father spent nights with mother"". Given that the DV was binary, I specified the following logistic regression model:

Discrepancy_i =1  = logit(p_i) = alpha + beta * fatherSpentNightsWithMother_i + gamma * controls,

Where controls contain: 
- Father spends nights with child only
- Living together at previous wave
- Father age (years)
- Couple White non-Hispanic
- Couple Hispanic
- Couple mixed race/ethnicity
- Child is a boy
- Child temperament
- Number of children together
- Mother multipartner fertility
- Father multipartner fertility
- Mother HS education or more
- Father HS education or more
- Mother employed
- Father employed
- Mother depression scale
- Father depression scale
- Traditional gender views, mother
- Traditional gender views, father
- Time between interviews (months)
- Visitation agreement
- Child support order
- Father’s distance from mother
- Father visited hospital
- Father’s name on birth certificate
- Father gave money during pregnancy
- Father suggested abortion
- Mother experienced abuse -> not found in data set
- Father has substance use problem
- Father in jail

If the claim were true, one would expect a positive value for beta.

# Results

Results (with controls) show that the effect of ""father spent nights with mother"" on discrepancy is statistically significant and positive (beta = 1.37, p = 0.006). In line with the original paper, coefficients were transformed to an odds-ratio scale. The results show that the odds of discrepancy are 3.94 times higher when the father spent nights with the mother.

2023-03-16T22:33:00Z,D7B5R,Desmond_Demography_2015_qQ9Z,R,"To investigate whether renters who experienced a forced move relocated to poorer neighborhoods than those who moved under less-demanding circumstances, a linear regression analysis was planned with move type (factor with 3 levels: forced, responsive, or voluntary) as predictor and neighborhood poverty (i.e., the percentage of families below the poverty line in a neighborhood) as outcome. As requirements for the second task of the Multi100 project, the analysis must produce a single, main result in terms of statistical families of Z-, t-, F- or X2-tests. Further, the analysis should control for the following variables: (a) renter race (Black, Hispanic, or Other); (b) renter age (in years); (c) renter education (lower than high-school, high-school/GED, or greater than high-school); (d) whether renter previously received housing assistance (yes/no); (e) whether renter lives in a single mom household (yes/no); (f) whether renter obtained a criminal record prior to their move (yes/no); and, (g) whether renter had a child in the 2 years before their move (yes/no). To accommodate these requirements, it was hypothesized that neighborhood poverty for renters who moved due to forced circumstances would be higher compared to those that moved due to less-demanding circumstances (interpreted as either responsive or voluntary moves). An analysis of covariance with planned Helmert contrasts was conducted via a regression approach to compare the neighborhood poverty of renters with a forced move type with the neighborhood poverty of renters with responsive and voluntary move types.

Data pre-processing and data analysis were conducted in R (R Core Team, 2023). The primary data set for the analysis was the Milwaukee Area Renters Study (MARS) version 3, which was obtained from the Harvard Dataverse (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BLUU3U). Following Desmond and Shollenberger (2015), the MARS data was supplemented with summary data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for the state of Wisconsin, in the period of 2006-2010 (https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/summary_file/2010/data/5_year_seq_by_state/Wisconsin/Tracts_Block_Groups_Only/). Using a pre-processing script by Porter and Geng (2022) available on the Open Science Framework (OSF; https://osf.io/ctp7h/?view_only=680b15e6531d43de8cddf213ddb63608), predictor, outcome, control variables, and regression weights were obtained from the MARS and ACS data sets.

Next, a missing variable analysis was conducted on the resulting data set using the ‘missing_pattern’ function of package ‘finalfit’ (Harrison et al., 2023) in R. This was done to determine whether a multiple imputation procedure could be implemented to preserve as much of the data set as possible. If visual inspection of the pattern of missing data revealed that the missingness was completely at random, multiple imputation would be conducted using the ‘mice’ function of package ‘mice’ (van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudsdoorn, 2011) in R. Following recommendations in White et al. (2011), m = 50 imputed data sets would be created. Subsequently, the analysis of covariance would be conducted in each imputed data set using the ‘with’ function, and the results then pooled using the ‘pool’ function, from the same statistical package. If multiple imputation was not possible, listwise deletion would be applied, and the analysis would then be conducted using the ‘lm’ function in R.

Visual inspection of the pattern of missing data revealed that missing data points were missing completely at random. Thus, the analysis proceeded using the planned multiple imputation procedure. Controlling for the effects of race, age, education, past housing assistance, being in a single mom household, past criminal record, and being with a child under 2 years, a pooled t-statistic suggested that neighborhood poverty was significantly higher for renters who experienced a force move compared to that of renters who experienced a responsive or voluntary move,  t(560) = 2.726, p = .0066.

For women, the well-being gains (measured as self-report level of happiness) of marriage are different than those of cohabitation.

Dataset

The data used in this study is a subsample of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel administered by CentERdata (https://www.lissdata.nl). The dataset selected for this study corresponds to data collected on 7 waves of data acquisition, over the period November 2007–July 2015. This dataset was chosen because is the subsample used in the original study of Chen & van Ours (2018). 

The main variables of interest in this study included information on “well-being” or “happiness” (from the question “On the whole, how happy would you say you are?”), on being married (“Are you married to this partner?”), on live together with the partner (“Do you live together with this partner?”). Other variables of interest were also explored, including age (“Age respondent”) and gender (""Gender respondent""). In addition, some other variables were considered, including length of the relationship (""In what year did the relationship with your partner begin?""), length of living together (""In what year did you start living together with your partner?""), household income (""What was total net income of your household over the period from…"") and education (""What is the highest level of education that you have completed with diploma or certificate?""). Variables explored in this study are included in the LISS domains of family and household, personality, income, and work and schooling. The dataset consists of information of 13116 subjects. 

After exploring the data, income information was removed from the study because the data coding for missing values was unclear. Moreover, the education information contains 40 levels, and transforming that variable to ordinal requires information on the Dutch education system which is not available.

Given that the instructions of the task stated that only women should be analysed, and that only one statistic should be yielded, I obtained a subset of data of women in the first wave. With these data, two groups were formed. The married group included women who answered “yes” to both, being married, and living together with the partner. The cohabitation group included women who answered “no” to being married and “yes” to living together with the partner. The two groups were matched by sample size and age. The final dataset included 434 observations of 434 subjects in the married group and 434 observations of 434 subjects in the cohabitation group. Details of the groups can be found in Table 6 and in Figures 13-16.

Statistical analyses

To analyze differences on well-being gains on the married vs cohabitation groups, the happiness scoring was compared between these two groups. The distribution of happiness is not normal (Figures 13 and 14). Hence, non-parametric statistical tests were used. Wilcoxon test was used to compare the happiness scoring between groups. The stats package in R was used, specifically the function wilcox.test to fit the models and wilcox_effsize to compute effect sizes. Multiple comparisons were corrected with the Bonferroni method. The effect sizes were interpreted following recommendations of Khalilzadeh et al., (2017).

Results

Results from the comparison of the groups married and cohabitation are shown in Table 7. The happiness score was found to not be statistically significant (p=0.17). The effect size was very low (below the threshold to be considered low),with a value of 0.05. 

Discussion

The importance of taking other indicators apart from p-values when conducting quantitative research has been highlighted (Greenland et al., 2016; Khalilzadeh et al., 2017; Wasserstein et al., 2016). In addition, the importance of visualizing numerical summaries and graphical representations of the data have been also emphasized (Wasserstein et al., 2016). Accordingly, I am taking into account not only p-values, but also effect sizes and the examination of numerical summaries as well as graphical representations of the data, when drawing conclusions in this study.

The well-being differences between married and living-together groups is statistically not significant. Moreover, the effect sizes indicate that their scientific significance is not considerable. It is important to note that the effect size is below the thershold for considering it low (Khalilzadeh et al., 2017). Hence, in this study I conclude that ""there is not sufficient scientific evidence to claim that, for women, well-being gains of marriage are larger than those of cohabitation"".",W,73441.500,868,The test does not require degrees of freedom.,p-value,I based my conclusion on p-value and effect size.

Further, the dataset is very sparse and it is important to select variables based both on theoretical concerns and their missingness patterns. We selected variables corresponding to voter opinion on privatisation, the market economy, and foreign trade and investment. As per Task 2 instructions, performance mandate indicators were entirely removed from the dataset, as well as two variables which indicate opinions about the US (lbusa and lbusa_trade). We then calculated principal component scores for market-related opinion, before constructing the main model which was the final important step.

For task 2, four binary logit models were created with control. The dependent dichotomous variables were attack, attack 1, consider and consider 1. The independent variables were polity 1 (Attacker’s polity score), hostileMID (COW>3, use of force or war) and noconsideryrs (Time since last considered attack (t-1)). 

The controls were added as per the task description, i.e., polity2 (Target’s polity), s_un_regDUM (Foreign policy similarity), cap2 (Target’s power), pwration (power ratio), postArt56 (Article 56), postCW (Post–cold war), prgmyrs (Program years), NCAnosafetodate (Nuclear assistance), cap_1 (Attacker's power), contig (Contiguity), noattackyrs (No of attack years).  

Therefore, in this analysis, it was assumed that an increased salience of the proliferation threat is indicated by positive ongoing hostility, attacker’s policies and time since last consideration of attack by the attacker who either have used force or considered using force.

The data and files were cleaned and well-organized, so I did not need to conduct extensive preprocessing. I used R for all the analyses and used the required R packages specified in the replication files. I had conducted several additional analyses as part of Task 1, and I reused those analyses for this task.

## Research design
The original hypothesis in the paper that I retested was that the disruptive capacity of non-elites in a country (as measured by the share of people employed in manufacturing, mining, construction, and transport) is associated with democratic gains (as measured by VDEM's polyarchy index). The author's main test of the target claim in Table 4, Model 6 uses cross-national panel data for 64 countries across the time period of 1901-2003. The estimation strategy models the dependent variable as a function of the main independent variable, a lagged dependent variable, relevant control variables, and fixed effects for country and year. To avoid econometric problems, the sample is limited to countries for which there is at least 20 years of data, and the standard errors are clustered at the country level. The author's quantity of interest is the estimated long-run multiplier effect of disruptive capacity on democracy levels rather than the ""short-term effects"" of the regression coefficients. The author samples from a multivariate normal distribution based on the regression estimates to construct (a distribution of) estimates of the long-run multiplier; the 50%, 2.5% and 97.5% percentile values of that distribution are the estimate of the long-run multiplier and it's 95% confidence intervals. In conducting my analyses, I followed all these same statistical modeling choices, same model specification, and used the author's replication code wherever possible (particularly in calculating the long-run multiplier effects).

## Replication
I began by replicating the main finding from Table 4, Model 6. Except for some small deviation due to using a different randomization seed, I found bascially identical results.

## Additional Analysis: Investigating Results in Different Geographic & Temporal Time Periods
I reestimated the main regression while excluding various global regions one at a time to assess the degree to which these cross-national results depend on the experience of a particular set of countries. I also investigated how the hypothesized relationship holds up across time. To satisfy the Task 2 assignment of only reporting one test statistic from one additional test, I focus here on the results from reestimating the results of this general theory without the countries from the North American and Western European region (as labelled by the dataset).

Dropping North America and Western Europe cuts the sample size is half (but the number of observations remains large; n = 2184). Excluding this region has a dramatic effect on the results; the coefficient switches to a negative sign (-0.651) – opposite to the theory’s expectations. The confidence intervals overlap zero [-3.781, 2.662]. Only 34.7% of the estimated long-run multipliers in the distribution created from this regression model lies above zero (p = 0.653, one-tailed).

These changes suggest that the inferences in the paper depend heavily upon leveraging the experiences of countries in the advanced democracies of North America and Western Europe; without them, all the available countries from the rest of the world do not yield the same inferences about increasing employment in disruptive industries and democratization.

As for the analyses regarding time periods, I will briefly describe the results. For the latter part of the 20th century, the results support the original claims in the paper; increased employment share in manufacturing, mining, construction, and transport corresponds with democratic gains. And yet, at any given 50-year window in the first half of the 20th century, the relationship appears to be negative – increased employment share in manufacturing, mining, construction, and transport would be associated with decreases in democracy. This second finding suggests that the hypothesized relationship holds mainly within the latter part of the 20th century, but not in the before the 1950s or 1960s.",semi-parametric confidence intervals based on the t-statistic family,"[-3.781, 2.661]",2184,"NA - summarizing the distribution of estimated quantities sampled 10,000 times from a multivariate normal distribution based on regression estimates",p-value,0.6526,"I conclude that the data provide qualified support for the target claim, but the empirical support is limited in ways that are not obvious in the original paper.

2023-05-24T12:52:28Z,RTX71,Christensen_EurJournPersonality_2018_8R9d,R,"Openness to experience was assessed using the openness subscale of the BFAS. A single factor model for ordinal item scores was fitted using the R-package Lavaan. The model showed suboptimal fit to the data (RMSEA=.161, CFI=.674, SRMR=.106). Modification indices revealed a residual correlation between the eight and ninth BFAS item. Freely estimating this parameter resulted in acceptable model fit (RMSEA=.061, CFI=.954, SRMR=.050). The McDonald’s Omega estimated reliability of the BFAS was acceptable (=.74). Factor scores were estimated using the Empirical Bayes Model approach in Lavaan’s lavPredict function. The estimated openness to experience factor scores were dichotomized into a high and low openness group based on a median split, resulting in two datasets of N=258.

The verbal fluency task answers were cleaned up and transformed into binary data using the textcleaner function from the SemNetCleaner R-package. Corrections were checked manually for invalid responses (e.g., animal names like ‘life’ or ‘critters’). The cleaned-up dataset contained binary scores for each participant and each unique animal name, indicating whether or not a participant indicated each particular animal during the task. 

As part of step 2 of this project, a random sample of 90% of the network nodes was selected. The binary animal fluency task data were then split up into two subsets based on whether participants had high or low openness to experience factor scores. Animal scores were only retained in the dataset when they occurred more than once in both datasets, which applied to 147 animals. The final dataset for the network analysis consisted of 258 respondents (rows) and 147 animals (columns) for each openness to experience group.

Before conducting the network analysis, a cosine similarity matrix was calculated separately in each openness group using the cosine function in the lsa R-package. Next, the R-package NetworkToolbox was used to calculate the adjacency matrix and the node distance matrix in each group based on the cosine similarity matrices. The average shortest path length was calculated and was 3.079 in the low openness group and 2.773 in the high openness group.

Although the average shortest path lengths already suggest that the high openness to experience network was more interconnected than the low openness to experience network, further analysis was required to determine whether this difference is statistically significant. The R-package bootnet was used to draw 1000 bootstrap samples of each group’s network and to obtain the distance matrices. The average shortest path length was calculated for each group and bootstrap sample. A Welch two-sample t-test was used to test the null hypothesis of no difference between the two groups in the average shortest path lengths across all 1000 bootstrap samples. The findings indicated that the null hypothesis should be rejected, t(1995.9) = -23.59, p < .001.

The key independent variable still is ""disruptive capacity"" in t-1 (i.e., ""L.highcapratio"").

2023-05-26T15:27:09Z,XIX62,Usmani_AmJournSocio_2018_GJe4,R,"In the second part of the replication task, the only thing I changed was to use the v2x_polyarchy scores instead of polity2. I already used all control variables mentioned in task 2 in part 1. In the model that I report in this form, which estimates the effect of the one-year lag of disruptive capacity, I used control variables that were lagged by one year, similar to the main paper.


This is the description of my analysis from part 1, which I mostly used in part 2 as well (with minor changes in the text below):

My initial plan of replicating Usmani (2018) was to extend their analysis to incorporate longer treatment histories. If disruptive capacity influences democratic developments, it is safe to assume that it does so in a cumulative way, involving the effects of many past treatments. To estimate long-term cumulative effects, my aim was to use methods of causal inference for time-series data, namely Structural Nested Mean Models (Blackwell and Glynn, 2018), which appropriately adjust the influence of time-varying confounders for the effects of complex treatment histories.

However, I deviated from this initial plan, because results from first models, which only changed smaller details of the original paper’s analysis, already led to different results than in Usmani (2018). I then chose those models that only slightly deviated from the original model specifications by Usmani (2018). 

I used the same sample as in the original paper and also focused mainly on the effect of a one-year lag of disruptive capacity. One smaller deviation from Usmani (2018) that I applied to all models was that I modelled time as restricted cubic splines. This did not make a large difference to the original results.

However, the most important deviation was the inclusion of a 2-year lag of treatment as control for confounding due to past treatments (Imai and Kim, 2019). The inclusion of a two-year lagged treatment turned the positive effect of the one-year lagged treatment (the main independent variable in the original paper) insignificant and negative. Controlling for past treatments is important when estimating clearly defined causal effects in panel or time-series applications (Imai and Kim, 2019). Even though the original paper suggests to be interested in the long-term effects by using the long-run multiplier, its main conclusions are in the end based on estimates of the 1-year lag effect.

In the paper, the author reports long-run multipliers. Because these estimates are rather not familiar to sociologist, I chose to report the beta coefficients from an OLS regression. I think the most important distinction between the author’s models and mine is that I view the most distant lag of the treatment as a confounding variable. Long-run multipliers, in contrast, are based on the coefficients of the lagged treatments, basically assuming that each of the coefficients represent causal estimates.

To analyze the possibility that a prolonged exposure to disruptive capacity leads to democratization, I also checked the robustness of the results by estimating the effect of the  average of the past five year’s disruptive capacity on current polity2 scores. In this model, I also included a control for past treatments, in this case, a variable of disruptive capacity six years before the measurement of polity2 score. All other control variables were lagged six years as well. Again, the estimates of past five year’s disruptive capacity were significant and positive at first, but the results turned insignificant and negative after controlling for lagged covariates and lagged treatment.

Second, the life expectancy in China during the sample period is around 70. The effect of father-in-law on male son-in-law should be trivial.

Each observation corresponds to a participant during a particular month of their first relationship in which they cohabitated with their partner, along with whether during that month the participant and their partner continued living together, got married, or separated. Additionally, race / ethnicity, age, and education covariates were provided. The observations were drawn from a nationally representative sample of women between the ages of 15 and 44. (Although, unfortunately, sampling weights were not included.) Only individuals whose first cohabitation relationship occurred within five years of the date of their interview were included.

First, I reshaped the data to calculate for each participant what the ultimate status of their relationship was: marriage, separation, or censorship due to the relationship being on-going at the time of the interview. Then, I examined covariate balance across waves with respect to the duration of the relationship, the age of the participant at the beginning of their relationship, and the joint distribution of education and race / ethnicity. Visual inspection confirmed that the waves were not balanced on these covariates. To account for this, I fit a logistic regression predicting whether a participant's first cohabitation progressed to marriage, where I operationalize both separation as well as continuing to live together at the time of the interview as ""not progressing to marriage."" I include all of the covariates mentioned above: education interacted with race, age, and duration of relationship, as well as a linear term for the number of years between 1995 and the relevant wave of NSFG (""year""). The estimand of interest is the coefficient of ""year,"" which is -0.008, with a standard error of 0.007 (p = 0.26). I note that this estimand does not exactly capture the hypothesis in question: it is possible for the coefficient to be negative, but for a greater proportion of relationships to progress to marriage if the underlying demographics of the population change. A more satisfactory analysis would use the sampling weights to directly account for this possibility; however, these were not available, and given the magnitude of the covariate imbalance across waves, it seemed best to analyze the data under the assumption that bias due to covariate imbalance would outweigh bias due to demographic shift.

After fitting the model, I examine binned residual plots to check model fit, as well as calculate the model's AUC (0.68). The model checks do not reveal any issues with the fit, and the AUC suggests the model is relatively predictive, especially in light of the sparse nature of the covariates.

We used data from the period 1945-2003 and employed the Manifesto Method. As our data represent both Single-Member District (SMD) and Proportional Representation (PR) electoral systems, we filtered our data and retained only SMD entries. Also, rows that contained missing values were omitted.

Thus, as we aim to understand the relationship between our dependent variable and independent variables, a regression analysis is adopted. A linear model was specified, including the largest party's distance to the median voter as the dependent variable and effective party vote, party polarization, and ideology of the largest party as independent variables. These variables are chosen as they are direct and indirect measures of party competition and are related to the Manifesto Method. Augmented Dickey-Fuller results show that all time series are stationary. We checked for multicollinearity among predictor variables using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). The obtained results show a low level of multicollinearity among predictors (VIF < 5).

Results show that effective party vote and party polarization have statistically significant relationships with the proximity of the plurality vote winner to the median voter. Thus, effective party vote negatively influences the proximity of the plurality vote winner to the median voter (-1.790), which implies that when votes are more distributed among parties, the winning candidate is more likely to represent a more extreme point of view compared to the median voter.

Statistical analyses were conducted in R (4.2.3; R Core Team, 2023), using the function “lmer” of the R package lme4 (version 1-1-32; Bates et al., 2015).
My aim was to test whether the return decision of the second movers in the trust game affected the likelihood of participating in a laboratory experiment. To do that, I used a General Linear Mixed Model (Baayen, 2008) with binomial error distribution, testing whether participation in the laboratory experiment (response variable) was predicted by the amount returned in a trust game (predictor). Because it was possible that the amount returned had a different effect depending on other variables or experimental manipulations, I further included the fixed effect of subject’s sex (two-level factor: male or female), whether the subject was commerce student (two-level factor: yes or not), treatment (two-level factor: whether they were given the flyer before or after the trust game), whether subjects received $10 or $20, and the two-way interaction between these variables and the predictor. Because subjects were asked twice (one for $10 and one for $20), I included the subject’s ID as random effect. I also included the tutorial group as a random effect. Initially, 663 subjects were tested in the trust game (that is, 1326 data points). However, subjects do not always answer the two questions. From a total of 1326 data points, 71 were non-answers (38 subjects did not answer how much they would return from $10, and 33 did not answer how much they would return from $20). After removing these data points, our model consisted in 1255 data points from 653 subjects. To ease model convergence and interpretation of the estimates, numeric fixed effects (amount returned) was z-transformed to a mean 0 and standard deviation of 1 (Schielzeth, 2010). To keep type I error rates at the nominal level of 0.05 and avoid multiple testing (Forstmeier and Schielzeth, 2011), I used a full-null model approach, comparing the significance of the full model by means of a likelihood ratio test with a null model lacking the predictor (amount returned) but otherwise identical to the full model. I compared the two models by means of a likelihood ratio test (R function anova with argument test set to “Chisq”; Dobson and Barnett, 2018). P-values for individual effects were based on likelihood ratio tests comparing the full model with reduced models lacking each term, using the function “mixed” of the R-package “afex” (version 1.2-1; Singman et al,
2023). We calculated 95% confidence intervals by bootstrapping the model estimates. Finally, I evaluate the quality of the model following a series of steps. I checked for model stability by excluding subjects one at a time from the data and comparing model estimates derived for these subsets with the main model (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2012). Model was very unstable. This instability, together with the histograms of the best linear unbiased predictors, that were not normally distributed for Subject ID, can indicate influential cases and a lot of individual variability. To check for collinearity problems, I inspected Variance Inflation Factors (VIF; Field, 2005) using the function “vif” of the R-package “car” (version 3.0-5; Fox and Weisberg, 2019) from a linear model with the same terms as the full model but excluding interactions and random factors. I did not detect any collinearity issue (all VIF close to 1).

Control variables were given in task 2 (Traditional gender views, mother"", ""Traditional gender views, father"", Time between interviews (months), Visitation agreement, Child support order, Father’s distance from mother, Father visited hospital, Father’s name on birth certificate, Father gave money during pregnancy, Father suggested abortion, Mother experienced abuse, Father has substance use problem, Father in jail), yet, some were difficult to know how to code based on the little information for the control variables. The final sample consisted of N=1,339 children.

2023-06-04T19:49:04Z,FQF87,Waller_JournMarFam_2014_AXBY,R,"I keep the same filtering steps that I used for Task 1, so the core dataset I use is the same. 

However, this time, instead of using the direct question of who the child lives with as the dependent variable, I use information from the household roster. I use the sex of the focal child (cm1bsex) and the age of the focal child at interview (in months) and then compare this against the age and gender of any biological children mentioned in the household roster (f4f2d1-10, f4f2c1-10). If the age and gender of a biological child in the household matches that of the focal child, it is assumed to be the focal child.  

Multiple control variables were created for the analysis. 

Traditional gender views (mother) and traditional gender views (father) was constructed based on three questions: “The important decisions in the family should be made by the man of the house”, “Is it better if husband earns the main living and woman cares for family?” and “Fathers play more important role in raising boys than in raising girls” (agree/disagree). The mean across these three was taken, including NAs. Then, if the mean was higher than 2, the variable was coded as 1, corresponding to participants selecting agree or strongly agree on average, whilst an average equal to or below 2 was coded as 0, indicating the respondent did not hold traditional gender views. The data for the fathers had a high number of missings, therefore data was imputed using the mice package in R. The imputation was carried out on the 3 raw variables, before the index was built. 


The time between interviews is measured in months, based on the month and year of the mother’s and father’s interview (cm4intyr, cm4intmon, cf4intyr, cf4intmon). 

Visitation agreement is measured using the question “Does child support agreement specify visits between child and you?”” (mothers) or “Does child support agreement specify visits between child and father?” (fathers). If either the mother or the father responded with yes in wave 4, then the binary variable is coded 1. In case of a discrepancy, the mother’s report is taken over the father’s. This variable also had a high number of missings (550) and thus I also used the mice package in R to impute values. 

Child support order is based on the questions “You have legal agrmnt/child support ordr requiring father financ. support child?” and “You have legal agreement/child supp order required provide financial support?” (m4c13, f4c13) and “INT CHK: DID FATHER AND MOTHER HAVE A LEGAL AGREEMENT/SUPPORT ORDER AT LAST INTERVIEW”/ INT CHK: DID MOTHER AND FATHER HAVE LEGAL AGREEMENT/SUPPORT ORDER AT LAST INT?” (f4c12, m4c12)  Information from the two sources were combined to create a binary variable, prioritising mother’s reports in case of a discrepancy. 

The distance between the two parents is calculated using the question “Approximately how many miles from your home does father/mother live?” (m4c35b and f4c35b) using the mother’s report. In case the mother’s report is missing, the father’s report is used. This is a categorical variable (1 = 0-10 miles, 2 = 11-30 miles, 3 = 31-60 miles, 4 = 61-100 miles, 5 = 101+ miles). 

Father’s hospital visit is recorded as 0/1, based on mother’s response in the baseline survey to “*Has bio dad visited you in the hospital?” (m1a7). 

Whether the father’s name is on the birth certificate is based on mother’s and father’s reports. If they were discrepant, then the mother’s report was prioritised. If one report was missing, the other was used. The question asked was “Will your/the father’s name be on the birth certificate?” (f1a5 and m1a6). 

Regarding whether the father gave the mother money during pregnancy, again, both parents’ reports were used to create a binary variable (0= no, 1 = yes). In case of a discrepancy, the mother’s report was prioritised. (“During bio mom preg, did you give her money or buy things for the baby/ies?/ During preg, did bio dad give money to buy things for baby/babies?”, f1b16, m1b16). 

For father suggested abortion, there is a binary variable (1= yes, 0 = no). In case of discrepancy, the father’s report is prioritised. (Did you suggest that she have an abortion? (f1b28) and “Did bio dad suggest that you have an abortion?” (m1b28). 

Mother experienced abuse is not available in the present dataset. Experience of abuse is determined based on medical records that are only available in the restricted dataset. 

Father has substance use problem is based on the variable f4j22j (“INT CHK: DID RESPONDENT USE ONE OR MORE DRUGS?”), which is coded as 1= yes, 0 = no. 

Father in jail is also a binary variable, based on the constructed variable based on mother’s and father’s reports (cm4ffinjail).( “Constructed - mother and father reports, father in jail at either 5-yr int” (0 = no, 1 yes). 

The hypothesis tested is: Fathers and mothers spending nights together is associated with an increase of the mean discrepancy rate (i.e. increase in conflicting reports where the child lives). 

To test this, a logistic regression was estimated using RStudio.  Odds ratios were also calculated. 

When all variables (apart from abuse) were included, there was complete separation of the data stemming from the variable “jail”. When this variable was removed the separation did not occur. 

The inclusion or exclusion of the jail variable does not alter the direction nor the significance of the coefficient of interest. 

I estimated many different models, in all of them, there is no support for a statistically significant effect that supports the claim. This includes having the distance variable as a factor (correct setting for a categorical variable) and treating it as a continuous measure; including gender views as measured by only one item (“Is it better if husband earns the main living and woman cares for family?”), coding discrepant reports as a separate category rather than prioritising mother’s reports in all cases where this applied. While the size of the coefficient changed, the statistical significance did not. 

I am reporting the results for a logistic regression with discrepancies in the household roster (1 = yes, 0 = no) as the dependent variable, and father spending nights with the mother (1/0) as the independent variable. The controls are mother’s traditional gender role view (1/0) , father’s traditional gender role view (1/0), the time difference between the parents’ interviews in months, whether there is a visitation agreement (1/0), whether there is a child support order (1/0), the distance between the parent’s houses (categorical variable: (1 = 0-10 miles, 2 = 11-30 miles, 3 = 31-60 miles, 4 = 61-100 miles, 5 = 101+ miles), whether the father visited the mother in hospital (1/0), whether the father’s name is on the birth certificate (1/0), whether the father gave the mother money during pregnancy (1/0), whether the father suggested the mother have an abortion (1/0)  and whether the father abuses substances (1/0).

As a recap, I used the city and economic panel datasets provided by Jiang et al. (2018) to gather all relevant variables for the analysis. The merged dataset includes 5656 observations from 333 Chinese cities located in 27 provinces gathered between 1999 to 2015. Following the protocol by Jiang et al. (2018), the province Tibet was excluded, as well as all observations from 1990 and 2012 to 2015 and those that had missing values on any of the variables included in the final analysis. This yielded a final dataset with 3693 observations from 326 cities and 26 provinces taken between 2000 and 2011. 
In contrast to Jiang et al. (2018), I fit a linear mixed effects model instead of a fixed effects model as the interest does not lie in city-specific effects and as a mixed effects model does not need to estimate as many parameters as the fixed effects model. R version 4.2.1. and the lme4 package were used for the analyses. 
The dependent variable in the final mixed effects model is GDP growth at t+2 and the independent variable of interest is a binary variable indicating whether the city mayor and/or secretary have an informal connection with the province secretary specified as a fixed effect. Year was included as a fixed effect as well as an intercept and several time-varying control variables: (a) City economic variables including: 
(1)	Net transfer (i.e., the difference between fiscal expenditure and revenue at t+1, standardized),
(2)	Log GDP growth*,
(3)	Log GDP*,
(4)	Log population*,
(5)	Log investment*,
 and (b) city leader variables (i.e. for secretaries and mayors separately) including:
(1)	Age,
(2)	Highest education level,
(3)	Gender,
(4)	Tenure dummy variable indicating whether the tenure was less than 1 year, between 1 and 3 years and between 3 and five years. 
I used averages over secretaries and mayors regarding the city economic variables to reduce multicollinearity in the model (as indicated by * and explained in the footnote) and standardized net transfer and took the logarithm of GDP growth to have comparable magnitudes for the predictors in the model. Plots of the city-specific and average trajectories of  GDP growth at t+2 suggested the inclusion of a random city intercept in the mixed effects model. As cities are nested within provinces, I specified a multi-level random effects structure with a random intercept for provinces and cities nested in provinces. The model was fit using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) indicated significance for the specified random intercepts. Therefore, the random effects structure was not simplified. The fixed parameter estimates were tested with LRTs using maximum likelihood and Satterthwaite degrees of freedom. The overall effect of the independent variable of interest connectedness on GDP growth at t+2 controlling for city economic and city leader variables was very small and not significant; estimate = 0.0478, SE = 0.1367, F(1, 3451.8)=0.1223, p=0.7266. This is the overall effect of connectedness on GDP growth at t+2 and not the province- or city-specific effect, all else being equal. So, on average, connections between city leaders (i.e. mayor and/or secretary) and the province secretary in China observed between 2000 and 2011 are positively associated with GDP growth at t+2, but this association is not significant and rather small.

2023-06-16T23:00:25Z,PRL47,Teney_EurSocioRev_2016_qXX2,Stata,"1. Data preparation and variable description
The analyses are based on Data from 17 Eurobarometer (henceforth: EB) datasets, of which one (EB 61.0 [ZA4056]) only encompasses the original EU-15 countries and one (CC 2004.1 [ZA4246]) encompasses only the (then) candidate countries. The remaining 15 datasets are Standard Eurobarometer datasets encompassing both the EU-15-countries as well as candidate countries/new member countries: 62.0 [ZA4229], 63.4 [ZA4411], 64.2 [ZA4414], 65.2 [ZA4506], 67.2 [ZA4530], 69.2 [ZA4744], 10.1, 70.1 [ZA4819], 71.3 [ZA4973], 72.1 [ZA4975], 72.4 [ZA4994], 73.4 [ZA5234], 74.2 [ZA5449], 75.3 [ZA5481], 76.3 [ZA5567], 77.3 [ZA5612], 78.1 [ZA5685], 79.3 [ZA5689]. The selection of datasets was mostly based on Teney (2016, 622): Teney does not list the CC 2004.1 explicitly, but since data from these countries in that year are used in the article it is likely that she included this dataset as well. She further lists EB 10.1 which does not exist and since the EB 10 was fielded in 1978 I assumed it actually meant EB 70.1. All datasets were assigned to the year and quarter of their field time. When the field time spanned multiple quarters, the record was assigned to the quarter in which more of the field time fell.
The EBs contain a battery that asks respondents to indicate what the European Union means to them personally. The respondents are provided with a list of 14 aspects to choose from: “Peace”, “Democracy”, “Economic prosperity”, “Social protection”, “Freedom to travel, study and work anywhere in the European Union”, “Cultural diversity”, “Stronger say in the world”, “Euro”, “Unemployment”, “Bureaucracy”, “Waste of money”, “Loss of our cultural identity”, “More crime”, “Not enough control at external frontiers”. The aspects are coded as mentioned (1) or not mentioned (0) and respondents can mention from none to all of the aspects. Only in the CC 2004.1 non-response options were provided for each of the aspects and not the battery as a whole. Therefore, the non-responses in this dataset were recoded to 0 ‘not mentioned’. 
To capture the positive non-materialist form of EU framing, which Teney (2016) dubbed as ‘cosmopolitan EU framing’, I generate a sum-index of the aspects  “Peace”, “Democracy”, “Freedom to travel, study and work anywhere in the European Union”, “Cultural diversity”, and “Stronger say in the world”, where each aspect counts as 1 if mentioned and divide it by the total amount of aspects mentioned by a respondent – not including “Euro”, a rather ambivalent aspect, which was also excluded in the analysis by Teney (2016). Due to the fact that some respondents did not mention any of the 13 aspects, two versions of this ‘cosmopolitan EU framing’ are generated: in the first version, respondents who did not mention any of the aspects are coded ‘0’, in the second version they are excluded (coded as missing). Both indices can take values from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a more cosmopolitan EU-framing. 
As control variables I use education, age, gender, occupation status, and type of community. Education is measured via the age when full-time education was completed. Those who are still studying were recoded to their current age. The variable was then categorized into three levels of education: low (less than 16 years), middle (16-19 years, reference category), and high (20 and more years). Age is measured in years and centered at each wave’s average age. Gender is a binary variable that takes the value 0 for men and 1 for women. Occupation status is a categorical variable that captures eight status: 1 “Self-employed”, 2 “Managers”, 3 ”Other white collars”, 4 “Manual workers” (reference category), 5 “House persons”, 6 “Unemployed”, 7 ”Retired”, and 8 ”Students”. Type of community captures whether people live in a small town, a town (reference category) or a city. Unfortunately, the EB does not offer measures of income or the households’ financial situation in the majority of waves.
As a measure of poor economic performance, I use the quarterly unemployment rate of the total population aged 25 to 64 in percent. As robustness checks, other age ranges (15-64, 15-74, 20-64, 25-74) were tested too, for the total population as well as separated in male and female unemployment rates. The data is retrieved from the Eurostat (2023c). The quarterly unemployment rate has about 1% missing values (Cyprus: 4/27, Germany: 6/27, Malta: 3/27, Luxembourg: 1/27) that were linearly interpolated. 
On macro-level I further control for the European debt crisis, national prosperity, as well as growth rates of national prosperity and unemployment. I generate a European-debt-crisis-dummy that takes the value 0 for all quarters before the onset of the crisis in 2009, and the value 1 from 2009 onwards. To operationalize national prosperity I use quarterly, seasonally and calendar adjusted data of the gross domestic product at market prices (Current prices, million euro) divided by the total population of the country (annually, number). The resulting values are log-transformed. To capture economic growth, I calculate growth rates from the quarterly, seasonally and calendar adjusted data of the gross domestic product at market prices (Current prices, million euro) for the comparison of each EB-wave’s quarter to the last quarter. To capture changes in unemployment rates, I calculate growth rates of the quarterly unemployment rate compared to the last quarter and to the same quarter of the past year. The data is retrieved from the Eurostat (2023a, b, c).
2. Hypotheses
H1: The higher the quarterly unemployment rate is in a country, the less positive is the cosmopolitan EU-framing in this country.
3. Analysis strategy
I use multilevel analysis to account for the nested structure of the data: the individuals (Level 1) are nested in country-waves (Level 2) which are nested in countries (Level 3). The ICC (intraclass correlation coefficient) reveals that nearly all of the variability in the dependent variables is at individual-level: about 96% for ‘cosmopolitan EU-framing’ both for the full sample and when people with only non-mentions on the EU-aspects are excluded. 
To test whether the cosmopolitan EU-framing is more prevalent in EU-countries with better economic performance – that is lower unemployment rates – in a first step I estimate multilevel regressions of the two cosmopolitan EU-framing variables (‘A’ with and ‘B’ without people with non-mentions) on the individual level variables and the quarterly unemployment rates (Models A1 & A2). In a second step I then iteratively add the macro-level controls economic prosperity (A2 & B2) and growth (A3 & B3), EU-debt crisis-dummy (A4 & B4), and unemployment rate growth compared to the former quarter (A5 & B5) and compared to the same quarter of the past year (A6 & B6). The first and second step are performed for all unemployment rate measures described above (five age ranges, total population, male and female) to check whether there are substantial differences between the measures.
In a third step I estimate the multilevel regressions of the two cosmopolitan EU-framing variables (A with and B without people with non-mentions) on the individual level variables and the quarterly unemployment rate of the total population for the ages 25-64, controlling for economic prosperity and growth, EU-debt crisis, and unemployment rate growth compared to the same quarter of the past year (Models A7 & B7). In Models A8 and B8 I estimate free slopes for all individual-level variables in country level (Level 3). In Models A9 and B9 I then estimate a cross-level interaction between individual occupation or employment status and the unemployment rate. Models A9 and B9 serve as a robustness check to test whether the negative relationship between unemployment rate and cosmopolitan EU-framing differs between the working population and the rest. 
4. Results
4.1 Three-level models of cosmopolitan EU-framing on unemployment rate, macro-level and individual-level controls
Overall, there is a negative link between unemployment rate and cosmopolitan EU-framing. The link is sometimes somewhat stronger when respondents who did not mention any of the aspects of what the EU means to them were excluded.
There are only very few and very small differences in effect strength between unemployment rates for different age ranges; the male unemployment rate shows the weakest association with cosmopolitan EU-framing, the female unemployment rates the strongest. Controlling for economic prosperity (A2 & B2) and growth (A3 & B3) has barely any effect on the relationship between unemployment rates and cosmopolitan EU-framing. Controlling for the EU-debt-crisis (A4 & B4) weakens the relationship between unemployment rates and cosmopolitan EU-framing, indicating that part of the negative relationship is due to the crisis which (in most countries) went hand in hand with high unemployment rates and economic insecurity. Neither of the unemployment growth rates (A5 & B5 | A6 & B6) had any impact on cosmopolitan EU-framing; controlling for unemployment growth rates had barely any effect on the relationship between unemployment rates and cosmopolitan EU-framing.
4.2 Three-level models of cosmopolitan EU-framing on the unemployment rate of the total population (ages 25-64), macro-level controls, and individual-level controls with free slopes
In the final step I chose on of the above models to produce a single, main result. Since the different measures of unemployment rates do not differ much in their relationship with cosmopolitan EU-framing, I chose the unemployment rate of the total population aged 25 to 64 because in most European countries most people will have finished their education und thus enter the labor force by age 25 and will be retired after age 65. The values reported in the Post-analysis survey stem from Model B8.
The results of Models A7 and B7 are identical to A6 and B6 for the unemployment rate of the total population aged 25 to 64. Allowing for the slopes of the individual-level variables to vary between countries (A8 & B8) does not substantially change any of the results, if anything, the effects of the financial crisis and economic prosperity become negligible stronger while the effect of the unemployment rate (B8) becomes marginally smaller. The interaction between occupation/employment status and the unemployment rate reveals that the cosmopolitan EU-framing of all but two groups is affected: The height of the unemployment rate is irrelevant for the cosmopolitan EU-framing of managers and students. 
5. Short Summary
Overall the analysis finds support for Hypothesis 1: There is a consistently negative relationship between unemployment rate and cosmopolitan EU-framing. It would be interesting to investigate whether the relationship would also be negative for managers and students if the aspect “freedom to travel, study and work anywhere in the EU” were not included in the measure of cosmopolitan EU-framing.

2023-06-22T14:56:01Z,IVZ84,Raley_JournMarFam_2012_D2LY,Stata,"I used the NLSY 1997 data for my analysis. I relied on the monthly-study episodes data of those who had enrolled at least once in a 2-year or 4-year college. In doing so, I use information on college enrollment and study patterns from January 1997 to December 2011, since the original study was published in 2012. I include only women in my analyses (N = 4,385). Further, only those women who enrolled in a 2-year or 4-year college for at least one month during the analysis period (N = 3,016). Of these, I analyze only those who had not yet become pregnant prior to first enrollment (N =2,535).
In the following, I will first present the variables used and the operationalization of these, before going into detail about the statistical procedure. 
The central dependent variable for testing the claim is the study outcome for students who enrolled in a 2-year or 4-year college. I distinguish between three possible events: graduation, dropout, and censored. 
A person is classified as a graduate if he or she graduates within 60 months (2-year college) or 84 months (4-year college) after first enrollment.
A person is assigned dropout as a study outcome if they have not graduated after 60/84 months and are no longer enrolled in college after 60/84 months, respectively. Furthermore, a person is assigned a dropout if he or she was not enrolled in college for twelve consecutive months within the first 60/84 months after enrolment.
Individuals who are still enrolled at 60/84 months after first enrollment or at the time of the most recent interview (if this occurred within the first 60/84 months after first enrollment) and have not received a degree and have not been enrolled in college for less than 12 months at a time are categorized as censored in their study outcome.
The central independent variable is the time-varying variable pregnancy. I have mapped this variable using two different approaches. In the first approach, the individual is assigned the value 1 in each month starting 7 months before the birth of the first child. In the months before that, the person is assigned the value 0. Individuals who never had a child are assigned the value 0 in each month. In the second approach, I create two time-varying variables. One is pregnancy and the other is first child. The difference to the pregnancy indicator of the first approach is that the pregnancy indicator changes back to 0 in the birth month of the child. From the birth month of the first child this indicator takes the value 1, before that and for all persons without child the value 0 in every month.
The following control variables are included in the analyses: year of birth (1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984), race (Non-Black / Non-Hispanic, Black, Hispanic), month of frst college enrollment (century months since January 1980), NLSY 1997 sample type (cross-sectional or oversampled), depression indicator (measured in the year 2000; how often felt depressed (4 categories (all of the time to - none of the time), general health indicator (measured in 1997, 5 categories (excellent - poor), ASVAB verbal math score percentile (0-100), ever arrested indicator (never, before first enrollment, after first enrollment), and highest parental education (1-20 years).
Because of too few cases in individual categories in selected variables (depressed (all the time; N = 14) race (Mixed Race (Non-Hispanic); N = 20) and general health (poor; N = 5)) students were excluded. Furthermore, 20 students were excluded because they reported college enrollment episodes after the last interview date.
I have calculated complete case analysis resulting in a case number of 798 for the 2-year college sample and a case number of 1,144 for the 4-year college sample. For the 2-year college sample I consider episodes up to 60 months after first enrollment and for the 4-year college sample I consider episodes up to 84 months after first enrollment.
For the analysis of the influence of pregnancy on college dropout of female students, I chose to use event history procedures.  For the following reasons, I think these procedures are appropriate for analyzing this process. The event dropout can (theoretically) occur at any time after a person enrolls. Similarly, pregnancy can occur temporally at any time. Event history analyses can account for this temporal dimension of the event as well as the temporal dimension of the occurrence of the pregnancy. Thus, pregnancy can be considered as a time-varying variable and, in addition, these procedures also allow us to determine the effect of the timing of pregnancy on dropout. Furthermore, censored cases (still enrolled and neither graduated nor dropped out) and competing risks (dropout vs graduation) can be considered.
To estimate the impact of the choice of statistical procedure on the statistical effect, I estimated several regression models from the family of event-history analyses: exponential survival models, Cox proportional hazards model, competing-risks regression, and piecewise-constant exponential survival models (1 year episode split). I estimate two models for each of these procedures and each of the two operationalizations of Pregnancy. Model 1 contains only time varying indicators of pregnancy. Model 2 additionally contains all the control variables mentioned above.
As recommended by the NLS, I do not use weighting variables for the regression analyses (https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy97/using-and-understanding-the-data/sample-weights-design-effects). 
I define the process time (in months) to an event (dropout, censoring or graduation) as follows. For individuals who graduate, the process time is the difference between the first enrollment and the month of graduation. For individuals who drop out of college, it is the difference between the first enrollment and the first month of a 12-month not enrollment spell or the difference between the first enrollment and the last observed study episode. For those who are censored, the process time is the difference between the first enrollment and the last observed study episode or the difference between the first enrollment and the time of the last interview (insofar as the interview took place within 60 or 84 months of the first enrollment).

I test the statistical hypothesis to what extent the effect of the time-varying pregnancy variables (considering various control variables) on the event college dropout is statistically significantly different from 0.


Specific instructions task 2 
You should not include marriage, cohabitation, and employment variables in your analysis.
You should not include the interaction term between gender and pregnancy in your analysis.
Since I already examined only women in Task 1 and did not include marriage, cohabitation, or employment analyses, I report the same analyses as for Task 1. In the survey, I then report only the results of the competing risk models of the first modeling approach for the 4-year college sample.

2023-07-04T08:51:05Z,KKX36,Raley_JournMarFam_2012_D2LY,Stata,"This analysis aimed to test the hypothesis put forth by Raley et al. in their 2012 paper, which suggested that pregnancies increased the risk of college dropout for women. In order to investigate the association between pregnancies and college dropout among women in their first college episode, an independent analysis was conducted using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). The exact hypothesis was: Pregnancies increase the risk that women end their first college episode at two- and four-year colleges without obtaining a degree. 

The NLSY panel data was downloaded from the NLSY website (https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/search). The survey followed individuals born between 1980 and 1984, collecting detailed information through regular interviews. The specific “tagset” used for this analysis was ""SCORE_Reproduction.NLSY97,"" which was provided on the OSF platform. It included a subset of NLSY variables from 15 rounds of data collected between 1997 to 2011. As I was unfamiliar the with the data and the available variables, relying on the “tagset” provided seemed to be the most promising strategy, given time constraints. To determine the timing and degree status of the first college episode for each person, several variables were utilized, including monthly college status (not enrolled, enrolled at 2-year or 4-year institutions, or graduate school) and the highest degree obtained in 2011. Later episodes of re-enrollment after stop-outs were excluded for simplicity. Additionally, the birth month of the first child was used to identify pregnancy months, with a 9-month period prior to the birth month considered as the pregnancy period. The birth month information was deemed more reliable and less prone to measurement error compared to the pregnancy indicator included in the dataset.

To address the research question and control for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity, a fixed-effects panel regression model was chosen. By including fixed effects and ""demeaning"" the data, the model accounted for all unobserved time-invariant factors, thus reducing omitted variable bias and providing more reliable estimates. Age, a time-varying factor, was included as a covariate in the model because it likely influences both pregnancy and college dropout. While the inclusion of additional time-varying factors, such as college performance, would have been desirable, such information was not available in the data provided.

The final analytical sample consisted of 2,486 women and 2,125 men, with observation periods ranging from 2 to 124 months until the first stop-out. The total number of observation months amounted to 123,544. It is worth noting that less than two percent of these months were categorized as pregnancy months, indicating that pregnancy during the first college episode was a relatively rare occurrence. The sample size may appear small; however, this is due to the fixed-effects logic employed. Only individuals who were enrolled in college and not pregnant upon enrollment were considered ""at risk"" of becoming pregnant and subsequently dropping out. Persons who had never enrolled in college and person-months prior to or after college were excluded from the analysis sample.

Results

The result of the analysis revealed a significant association between pregnancies and an increased risk of college dropout for women in their first college episode. Overall, a pregnancy was found to increase the probability of discontinuing the first study episode by 3 percentage points (Model FFEtask2 in the log file: b = 0.032, panel-robust S.E. = 0.007, t = 4.875, n (women) = 2,486, n (person-months) = 68,145, df = 2,482).

I do this using migrant data from the Mexican Migration Project and Latin-American Migration project, which reports the wage and year of their last job in each of their home country and the United States. I exclude data from Puerto Rico, a richer country.

For each migrant, I convert the wages of the home job into US dollars, and then adjust the wage of the earlier job to that of the latter job by the growth rate of an equivalent worker with the same sex, experience and education. This enables the calculation of the gain in wage on migration between two equivalent wages.

I converted education years into a categorical variable to enable matching with data on wage growth (from the Current Population Survey) and for a direct test of the hypothesis comparing wages between two groups of migrants, those with no high school and those with a college degree.

In my base model, I regress the gain in log wage against a dummy variable for each education level, with the reference category being college graduates. I use country fixed effects via a dummy variable for each country of origin. I find evidence in support of the claim. In the base model, I find that those who do not finish high school (t(2613)=3.17; p=0.00271) have larger wage gains on migration. These gains equate to a 40% larger wage gain.

2023-07-10T00:15:58Z,JHG33,Jiang_AmJourPoliSci_2018_Rjp9,R,"Pre-processing steps already reported in Task 1

The independent analysis carried out in Task 1 employed the Generalized Synthetic Control Method (GSCM), as described in Xu (2017). This method amalgamates the Synthetic Control Method (Abadie, 2021) with linear fixed-effects models to enhance efficiency and interpretability. The GSCM allows treatment to start at different times for different units and accommodates unbalanced panels. These two features are vital for replicating Jiang (2018), as the panel data used in that study is unbalanced, with approximately 25% of the observations under control and 75% treated. Furthermore, each city has an individual treatment timeline in which connections might be activated and deactivated several times.""
Typically, the Synthetic Control Method is applied when one unit is treated, while the remaining units form the control group. The GSCM, however, allows for multiple units to receive treatment, though it still requires a sufficient number of control units and pre-treatment periods. Because of these requirements, it is not feasible to utilize the full dataset employed by Jiang (2018) in the GSCM approach. To address these constraints, two main procedures were implemented to preprocess the dataset.

Firstly, rather than studying the effect of a leader with a connection to the provincial secretary, I examine the effect of a leader without such a connection. A new variable, named 'absence_connection', is created to identify periods when a city lacks a connection with the provincial politician. This step increases the number of observations in the control group, thereby facilitating the GSCM's creation of a synthetic control unit. From this point forward, when I refer to the 'treatment group', I am referring to cities without a connection, whereas the 'control group' refers to cities with a connection.

With this adjustment, the hypothesis being tested is that 'city leaders without informal ties to incumbent provincial leaders deliver slower economic growth than their connected counterparts.'

Secondly, since treatment is intermittent, i.e., a unit might enter and exit the treatment group several times within the analytical sample, I filtered out units with intermittent treatment, retaining only those units and time periods in which treatment status changed at most once. I retained 47 cities that had a consistent connection with the provincial secretary throughout the period from 1999 to 2010. These cities formed the control group, given they never lost their connection with the provincial politician. For the treatment group, I selected 104 cities that maintained a connection throughout the period from 1999 to 2005. This period was chosen as it covers approximately half of the sample and ensures there are enough pre-treatment periods to execute the GSCM. Subsequently, from these 104 cities, I eliminated those that changed their treatment status more than once after 2005. Following this process, 24 cities were retained.

Consequently, the analytical sample was reduced to 71 cities, with each city observed from 1999 to 2010 (12 periods), resulting in a total of 852 observations. Of this total, 9 observations were lost due to missing data in the control variables. The selection criterion for control variables was a minimal amount of missing values. The chosen variables included the logarithm of population, the logarithm of average nighttime brightness per square kilometer, the difference between fiscal expenditure and fiscal revenue (dep), and fiscal expenditure as a percentage of GDP.

Additional pre-processing procedure for Task 2

Task 2 requires to control for city economic and city leader variables. Since gsynth() does not accept missing values, it was necessary to exclude observations where dependent or independent variables had missing values. After this procedure, 761 observations were kept.

The following control were included:

City economic controls (the same used by the author in models 1 to 3 - Table 1 in the original paper)

startmsec_loggdp: Secretary - starting year log GDP
startmayor_loggdp: Mayor - starting year log GDP
startmsec_logpop: Secretary - starting year log population
startmayor_logpop: Mayor - starting year log population
startmsec_loginvest: Secretary - starting year log fixed asset investment
startmayor_loginvest: Mayor - starting year log fixed asset investment
dep: Fiscal Expenditure - Fiscal Revenue at t+1
startmsec_gdpidx: Secretary - starting year GDP index
startmayor_gdpidx: Mayor - starting year GDP index

City leader controls (the same used by the author in models 1 to 3 - Table 1 in the original paper)

msec_female: dummy indicating female city secretary
mayor_female: dummy indicating female mayor
msec_edu: city secretary has college education
mayor_edu: mayor has college education
mayorage: mayor age
msecage: city secretary age
msec_in1: 1 if city secretary tenure is 0
msec_in3: 1 if city secretary tenure is larger than 0 and lower or equal to 2
msec_in5: 1 if city secretary tenure is larger than 2 and lower or equal to 4
mayor_in1: 1 if mayor tenure is 0
mayor_in3: 1 if mayor tenure is larger than 0 and lower or equal to 2
mayor_in5: 1 if mayor tenure is larger than 2 and lower or equal to 4

Note: msec_female and mayor_female presented no variation in the subset and were, therefore excluded of the model. 

The model resulted in an average ATT (Average Treatment Effect) of -2.3 (p-value = 0.011).

A second model was estimated excluding the year 1999. This was done for two reasons: firstly, most of the missing values were in 1999; second, 1999 was also excluded in the original article. After the exclusion, many variables still had missing values and were excluded. The second model controlled for the following variables: 

startmsec_loggdp: Secretary - starting year log GDP
startmayor_loggdp: Mayor - starting year log GDP
startmsec_logpop: Secretary - starting year log population
startmayor_logpop: Mayor - starting year log population
startmsec_loginvest: Secretary - starting year log fixed asset investment
startmayor_loginvest: Mayor - starting year log fixed asset investment
mayor_in1: 1 if mayor tenure is 0
mayor_in3: 1 if mayor tenure is larger than 0 and lower or equal to 2
mayor_in5: 1 if mayor tenure is larger than 2 and lower or equal to 4


The second model resulted in an average ATT (Average Treatment Effect) of -2.1 (p-value = 0.009). The model considered 69 cities over 11 time periods, i.e., 759 observations.

For the cities which lost their connection to the provincial politicians after 2005, the GSCM creates an artificial version that has not lost the connection. The gap between the GDP growth of these two versions represents the effect of either having or not having a connection. However, the effect of having a connection is reflected in the positive gap, while the effect of the absence of connection is seen in the negative gap between them. Please, consult the plots presented in the script to see the GDP growth trend of the treated units and their synthetic control. All these things considered, the hypothesis that 'city leaders with informal ties to incumbent provincial leaders deliver faster economic growth' can be confirmed.

The datasets were accessed using a private Open Science Framework link provided by the project coordinator. This included the Milwaukee Area Renters Study dataset (including open ended survey responses), a survey of 1,086 tenants in Milwaukee’s private housing sector. Only recent movers (n = 580), as classified in the survey were considered for the purpose of this anlaysis.

A second dataset, the American Community Survey (ACS) (2006– 2010) provided information on the percentage of families below the poverty line. Two items from this dataset: (1)- B17010_001- “Poverty status in the past 12 months %- Total” and (2) B17010_002- “Poverty status in the past 12 months - % income in the past 12 months below poverty level” were used. Our measure of poverty was calculated as the ratio of % income in the past 12 months below poverty level relative to total %.

Survey responses on current and previous address were matched with this poverty score. The MARS data and the ACS were matched based on Geographic Identifiers (GEOID) values (converted to 12-digit FIPS).

Participants responses relating in the MARS surey relating to the reasons for their move (see MARS user guide detailing that interviewers asked each respondent 6 ordered yes/no questions, beginning with involuntary removals and ending with voluntary moves) were coded as 1 for a response that indicated a forced move. In some cases, participants responded no to all 6 questions and were then asked follow up questions (“Were there other reasons you moved away from this place?” and “I see that none of these reasons fit your case. Why did you move away from this place?”) allowing for open ended responses. These responses were manually coded as forced (coded as 1) or voluntary (coded as 0). The manually coded responses have been uploaded along with the statement on the OSF repository.

In addition to this, information on participant demographics (race [binary coded for white, hispanic, black and other], education status, single mother status at prevous residence, whether they had been convicted of a crime prior to their move, had been recently fired, in receipt of public assistance, had received financial assistance at previous residence or recently had public assistance stopped) were also coded and used in the analysis.

The “mice” package in R was utilized for multiple imputation of missing data. Ten imputed datasets were generated allowing for more complete and robust analyses by estimating missing values based on observed data patterns.

A linear model (estimated using OLS) was used to predict the poverty score of the respondents current address based: on whether they had been forced to move, the poverty score of their previous address, ethnicity (entered individually for black, white, hispanic and other), education status, whether they had a conviction for crime before the move, whether they they were a single mother, whether they had a recent child, whether they had been fired, whether they had received financial assistance at previous residence, whether they were in receipt of public assistance, and whether that public assistance had been recently stopped.

The model explained a statistically significant and moderate proportion of variance (R2 = 0.15, F(15, 564) = 6.85, p < .001, adj. R2 = 0.13).

The full results of all the variables are reported above, but critically for evaluating the claim that “renters who experienced a forced move relocate to poorer … neighborhoods than those who move under less-demanding circumstances”, the effect of forced move was statistically non-significant (beta = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.01, 0.05], t(564) = 1.11, p = 0.265; Std. beta = 0.13, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.37]).",t-statistic,1.11,580,564,p-value,0.265,There was no statistically significant effect of being forced to move from the previous residence on the neighbourhood poverty rating of the current residence.,Opposite as claimed by the original study,No,Yes,16,559

The main result revealed a statistically significant effect of ""Mass support for the market"" on VRL, with a coefficient of 0.1737 (p = 0.041). Given the small number of countries (18), I am cautious about type I errors. Using robust standard errors - as in the paper - would yield a more significant p-value (p = 0.000).

To address the small-sample bias, I used the Wild bootstrap standard errors clustered at the country level, which captures heterogeneity, mitigates non-normality, and avoids data-driven assumptions.

2023-07-24T06:00:50Z,A75GH,Christensen_EurJournPersonality_2018_8R9d,R,"(using notes from before plus new stuff) Personality Scoring:
- The personality scoring was calculated by summing the BFASO## questions, with the assumption these have been rescored before uploading the raw data. There is no data codebook, so impossible to know which item is 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. The .que files that would provide this information are proprietary format and therefore unreadable. 
- This data appears to be the raw data. However, the remote associates data does not include the full raw data, and therefore, I cannot change who is included in the data (i.e., change attention check rules or other exclusion criteria). This data was then matched with the RAT data so that n = 516. 
- To create low and high groups for network analysis, I then binned the average openness scores into deciles. The bottom four deciles (1, 2, 3, 4) and the top four deciles (7, 8, 9, 10 were selected to create the low and high group, respectively. Data from 5 and 6 were dropped. This split keeps a large portion of the data but does not introduce the issues of median splits (i.e., the people in the middle are basically the same score). 

Text Cleaning:
- The data was first examined for issues of splitting answers from participants into columns. These issues were fixed. For example, if ""dog cat bear"" were included in ""answer 1"" column, this was split into ""dog"", ""cat"", ""bear"" to indicate it was three different answers. 
- The text was then lower cased to normalize across answers. 
- All punctuation and 99s for missing data were removed. 
- The data was then spell checked. During this process, I used hunspell to start by picking the most likely answer to each misspelled word. A spelling replacement dictionary was manually created by examining these answers. Words that were unclear (lima, sprikbok) and not actually misspelled (orca, capybara) were removed from the replacement dictionary. The replacement suggestions were individually checked and modified when appropriate. After checking these replacements, more items were added to the spelling dictionary that did not pop up orginally (bare -> bear). Different word forms were then normalized (all chimp -> chimpanzee).
- After replacing spelling errors, udpipe was used to find the lemma (root word) to eliminate plurals versus singular word forms. A similar replacement dictionary was created and hand checked. Words that should not be replaced (praying -> pray) were excluded. Words that were missed were added (eagles -> eagle, and a few odd typos that just wouldn't quit). A table of all the final words was investigated until all these issues were worked out to properly format the text. 
- Then all duplicated answers within one person (i.e., two listings of dog) were eliminated.
- The group label from the personality scoring was added to this data. 

Network Analysis:
- Singletons were removed by calculating the frequency of each concept listed by group. Concepts had to appear at least twice per group to be included. All other concepts below this criteria were excluded.
- The data was split into low and high groups, and all steps beyond this were calculated separately for each group. 
- A matrix of people (rows) by words (columns) was created with the frequency (1) of occurence as the data within the matrix. This represents a person by word frequency table. 
- The cosine values were calculated on this table using the lsa package. This matrix becomes a word by word weighted matrix where the values (cosine) represent how likely those two words are to co-occur across participants (it's a cosine distance measure, no negatives ** fixed this from last time, typo). 

Task 2:
- I used 1000 bootstrapped samples for this analysis without replacement. 
- The data that was used to create the models for low and high were sampled at 90%. Thus, the original words by words matrix (with cosine values in them) was reduced to 90% of its size. This procedure ensured that the network was 90% of the original size because 10% of nodes were removed. 

- For the network, I used igraph to create the network from the weighted cosine matrix using a directed graph. 
- I calculated the connectedness with average shortest path length using the mean_distance function in igraph. This value is weighted given the matrix is weighted, which makes these numbers small (i.e., like cosine values). This function creates the pairwise combination of distances. For each concept, I calculated the average distance. 
- I used an independent t-test with equal variances to compare the average distances for each group - as the people are separate in each group, even though the words are matched. 

Final Answer:
- I averaged the means to ensure the direction of the result was the same (it was).
- I averaged the t-test and p-values values to get one statistical result. 
- This t-test indicated a significant difference between groups using alpha < .05, t(260) = 4.568, p < .001. The low group (M = .123) had a higher score than the high openness group (M = .116).

2023-07-25T21:06:56Z,IDY90,Dahl_AmEcoRev_2012_VRKK,Stata,"The following incorporates some of my comments regarding Task 1. I also expand on the initial data preparation. 

In the first step, I closely followed the initial data preparation as conducted in the original replication files. These initial data preparations included:
– Obtaining post-tax and benefit incomes using the taxsim9 routine. 
– Converting incomes into real terms (in 2000 dollars).
– Computing standardised combined maths and reading scores based on the Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT). 
– Restricting the sample to individuals with absolute two-year after-tax total income changes of less than $40,000.
– Excluding individuals with absolute welfare receipt changes exceeding $2,500 when there is no corresponding opposite change in earned income of at least the same size.

Notably, I could not make use of any state information as this would have required access to the restricted version of the NLSY dataset. 

I closely followed the original data preparation for two reasons.  First, the dataset provided was rather opaque and without labels. Second, the taxsim9 package (which was required to get post-tax income information) was again opaque and very difficult to get running at all (in particular, on an M1 Mac the code only runs when Stata is executed via the terminal and after installing a number of further tools; see the code in the OSF archive for more details and instructions on how to get this running). 
 
In the second step, I estimated a two-stage least squares IV regression of changes in the combined math and reading scores of children (which, unlike the paper, I standardised *after* all sample restrictions were implemented) on instrumented changes in parental income. I here followed the identification strategy of the paper. I did so because the identification strategy implemented in the original paper appeared fundamentally sound to me. 

In the third step, I estimated a simple OLS regression of the combined math and reading scores of children on current parental income. This was done as one of the instructions read “You should disregard the first stage coefficient on instrument and focus on the current income instead in your analysis.”, which may be interpreted as asking for an analysis that does not use an IV-based identification strategy.  Interestingly that analysis yielded a very similar result. 

Regarding the task 2 instructions more broadly, I proceeded as follows:

1) You should use a single measure for math and reading achievements.
–> This is somewhat ambiguous. There is no single variable in the NLSY that would measure both kinds of abilities at the same time. I therefore continued to use single combined score of maths and reading ability as in the analysis for task 1. 

2) You should disregard the first stage coefficient on instrument and focus on the current income instead in your analysis.
-> As stated above, it was unclear to me whether I am asked to continue using the IV-based identification strategy that was also used in task 1 and the paper (but disregard any concerns about the first stage), or whether I am asked to not use the IV-based identification strategy at all. I therefore elected to do both, which resulted in very similar estimates. 

3) You should disregard Time Trends and Time-Varying State Policies.
–> Done.

4) You should not divide the sample into subgroups when conducting your analysis.
-> Done. 

5) You should also control for state school accountability and welfare policies.
–> With the data available this was unfortunately impossible. In order to incorporate these data, I would have to have access to the restricted NLSY dataset (as also pointed out by the original authors in their replication files)

6) Furthermore, you should not control for the control function or compute interactions with it.
–> Done. 

7) You should disregard state indicators and NLSY-supplied weights for mothers.
–> Done. As was also done for Task 1. 

8) You should not control for mother's labor-market participation and hours worked.
–> Done. As was also done for Task 1. 

9) You should not use the log family income when measuring income.""
-> Done. As was also done for Task 1. 

Finally, and to reiterate my comment on task 1, given the complexity of the dataset and the analytical strategy, it was not feasible to perform an entirely independent analysis – i.e. one which was not done by cross-checking, and in parts incorporating, the provided replication files – within the available time. In that sense, I was forced to place some trust in the authors initial coding choices.     

In terms of results, in my IV-based analysis I obtain a coefficient that is equal to 0.126. Substantively, this means that a $1,000 increase in income has a (short-run) causal effect of raising the average of math and reading scores by about 1.3% of a standard deviation. This effect is not statistically significant at a conventional α-level of 0.05. Using a two-sided hypothesis test I obtain a p-value of 0.065 (based on Z=1.84, N=5,691).
When alternatively estimating a simple OLS regression (see my comment to the second instruction) , I obtain a coefficient that is equal to 0.115. Using a two-sided hypothesis test I obtain a p-value of >0.000 (based on Z=12.00, N=5,691). However, it seems that the IV based estimate should be preferred, and is therefore reported on in the rest of this form.

The hypothesis tested was “the more differently valued are the issues over which states are bargaining, the more likely they are to offer concessions”.  This was tested by a correlation, analysis of variance and various predictive (mixed-) models.
Due to the noisy nature of the data and more complicated data types (ordered groups, instead of groups or continuous variables) the analysis was approached from different angles. First, a spearman ranked correlation was calculated to verify the (positive) relationship between the variables of interest. Then, an analysis of variance was performed to establish different means of the “issue_linkage_structure” variable which represented the “differently valued of the issues” part of the hypothesis. Finally, several predictive models and mixed-models were made to check the explanatory ability of the “issue_linkage_structure” when combined with other measured variables within the data set.

2023-08-18T13:37:33Z,C7WJL,Cohen_AmEcoRev_2015_2lb5,Stata,"The treatment variable in this experiment is the existence of a subsidy for ACT (Artemisinin-based combination therapy) purchase at a local pharmacy or shop.  Households were provided two vouchers for ACT purchase.  In this analysis, we focus on a single subsidy level (92%, equivalent to paying 40 Kenyan shillings for ACT, instead of its normal price of 500 shillings) as the treatment of interest, comparing this subsidy group to a no-subsidy control group.  

Randomization into treatment was performed at the household level, without apparent clustering of treatment assignment above the household level.  Our analysis takes place at the level of individual episodes of illness, which were captured in an endline survey.  Households averaged 2.53 episodes over the study period and almost all households (89.7%) had at least one episode of illness. To clarify, an illness episode is not equivalent to an episode of malaria; many episodes are non-malarial and only some cases were confirmed or disconfirmed through malaria testing. Our interest in this analysis is to understand, given an episode of illness the household believes to be malaria, whether they administered ACT to the sick household member.

We limit the sample for analysis in several important ways:
1. We do not include any households that received other levels of subsidy, such as an 80% subsidy on ACT.  There are only two groups -- the treatment group with a 92% subsidy and the control group with no subsidy at all.

2. We do not include any households that received a related form of subsidy for rapid diagnostic tests (RDT).  This is because the group that received RDT subsidies combined with an ACT subsidy may have been unduly influenced in their uptake of ACT by the fact that they also had a subsidy for a test.  Because we are interested in the impact of the subsidy alone, we exclude households that received an RDT subsidy.

3. Many households experienced more than 2 bouts of malaria-like illness during the study period, but households were only provided with two vouchers for ACT.  Therefore, we limit the analysis to the first 2 episodes of illness, as later episodes may have been ""untreated"" in a research design sense.  In other words, the household may have already used their voucher and choose not to take up ACT for the illness due to lack of a voucher.  This is consistent with the data -- the treatment effect of the subsidy is lower when we include later episodes (i.e. episode #3 or #4 for a given household).  

Our core analysis is a linear regression linking ACT uptake in episode i, household j, to the receipt of subsidized ACT vouchers by household j.  Because there are multiple episodes per household, we cluster standard errors at the household level.  We do not include any control variables as any observed or unobserved characteristics should be balaced, via randomization, in expectation.  In alternative models, we include these; however, because Task 2 requested a single statistical test, we focus on the simple model without controls, because it is our preferred version -- primarily because it does not result in a loss of cases due to data missingness on the controls.  In other words, including control variables results in a smaller sample size, with data missing (likely non-randomly); this drives our preference for the simple model.

The hypothesis we test is straightforward: do high levels of subsidization increase ACT uptake? We define ""high"" in line with the Task 2 instructions as 92%. Therefore, our test is whether ACT uptake is different between the group that received no ACT subsidy and the households that received a 92 percent subsidy.",z-statistic,5.878,845,438,p-value,0.000000008235,"A high subsidy rate for ACT, covering 92% of the non-subsidized price, increases ACT uptake by households when confronted with an illness they believe to be malarial, by around 21.2 percentage points, a difference that is statistically significant at all conventional levels.",Same as claimed by the original study,Yes,"No, I already had the neccessary calculations in Task 1",6,573

You should disregard geographic, colonial variables and the potentially endogenous set of variables such as GDP per capita, openness to trade, federal political structure, OECD membership, and demographic measures (but include mean responses as a control) in your analysis.
You should use the standard deviation of the responses to the GOV Economic Policy Question for quantifying political polarization.
You should use the general government consumption as a fraction of total consumption for measuring public spending.
This is quite similar to Task 1, but I made one additional assumption about the democracy scores for three countries: Iceland, Luxembourg, and Malta. This analysis assumes they all scored 10 on the democracy index, given their respective scores on political and civil rights indices in 2000 published by Freedom House (2005).

This analysis looks at how the standard deviation of the the economic policy question predicts the proportion of total consumption in a country that is general government government consumption. The general government consumption comes from Gwartney and Lawson (2008) and is based on data from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Importantly, this analysis looks at how this relationship varies as a function of a democracy index given to countries calculated by Marshall and Jaggers (2007). Additionally, there is a control of the mean response at the country level for the economic policy question. The economic policy question, “How would you place your views on this scale? 1 means that you completely agree with the statement,”People should take more responsibility to provide for themselves,” and 10 means that you completely agree with the statement, “The government should take more responsibility to ensure that everyone is provided for” was asked at the individual level within 83 countries, but only 72 have values for this analysis. The central analysis focuses on the interaction between the standard deviation of the economic policy question, calculated within country, and the democracy score, mean centered. The claim is that polarization has a negative relationship with government consumption at high values on the democratic index, and zero or potentially a positive relationship at lower values on the democratic index. Calculating the Johnson-Neyman point (Palmer and Jerzy, 1936; Spiller et al. 2013) at each value on the index tests what levels of democracy index scores correspond to a negative, indistinguishable from zero, or positive relationship between polarization and government consumption. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of how polarization and government consumption vary with democracy index values. Instead of drawing an arbitrary cutoff on the democracy index, this analysis tests how the relationship between polarization and government consumption varies with each of the possible values of the democracy index. With additional data, an analysis that did not assume linearity for this moderation would be even better.

A graph showing the simple effect of polarization on government consumption at the eleven possible democracy index values, shows that at democracy values equal to or higher than six, there is a negative and significant relationship between polarization and government consumption (when democracy index is 6: b = −5.89, t(67) = −2.98, p = .004). For democracy index values of five and lower, the relationship is not significantly different from zero (when democracy index is 5: b = −3.57, t(67) = −1.65, p = .10). When forced to use a single statistical test for this hypothesis, the interaction between democracy index and polarization is the best evidence for the claim. The interaction between the democracy index and the polarization measure is negative and significant (b = −2.32, t(67) = −4.01, p < .001). We find a negative and significant interaction between the democracy index and the polarization measure (b = −2.32, t(67) = −4.01, p < .001).",t-statistic,-4.007,72,67,p-value,0.0002,"The relationship between political polarization and government size depends on the democracy index.

2023-08-25T13:35:39Z,GKHP1,Waller_JournMarFam_2014_AXBY,R,"To perform this analysis I copied the steps (and code) from step 1 as I believed that this should be an extension. I read the original paper and the claim given in the task description from which started to do the analysis ""without looking at how the paper did it"". So I wanted to do the analysis from first principles.

I have provided a markdown file with comments. I would invite the reader to check these out as the exact survey items and comments can be seen in that file. 

Then: 
-download the data
-create the appropriate sample to study: these are observations where both parents are interviewed and which are not married
-create the appropriate variables as in task 1: cohabitation and disagreement as well as the control variables from task 1 + some new control variables as asked in task 2.
Now the control variables in task 2 have some leeway in how these are constructed. 

Traditional gender views (mother)
o	“The important decisions in the family should be done by the man” (M1d3a)
o	“It is better if husband earns the main living and woman cares for the family” (M1d3c)
o	“More important for man to spend time with his family than to work a lot” (M1d3f)

Here I only use the first item, because it is the most strict item. The same reasoning applies to traditional gender views (father) .

Categorical variables like time between interviews are transformed into multiple dummy variables (see markdown). I did the same for distance. There is a categorical variable which captures distance categories but this is transformed into distance dummies. 

For the variables: father visited hospital, fathers name on the birth certificate, father gave money during the pregnancy, we can always use the mother's perspective or the father's perspective (or combine in some way). I chose the perspective of the mother. 

Example: 
o	Has bio dad visited you in the hospital? (M1a7): yes / no
o	Will the father's name be on the birth certificate? (M1a6) yes/no
o	During pregnancy, did bio dad give money to buy things for baby/babies? (M1b16) yes/no

The idea is that the answer of the father is more likely to be socially desirable, though the mother could also provide wrong/misleading answers. 

For abortion and substance abuse I used both the answers of the father and the mother (using the OR operator, so if either the father or the mother suggested abortion, this is a yes). 

For abuse, I used multiple items to get an abuse indicator. 
o	How often father withhold money, make you ask for money, or take your money? (m4d7g)
o	How often does father slap or kick you? (M4d7h)
o	How often does father hit you with a fist or an object that could hurt you? (m4d7i)
o	How often father try to make you have sex or do sexual things you don't want? (m4d7j)
o	How often does father throw something at you? (m4d7m) 
o	How often does father push, grab, or shove you? (m4d7n) 
If the mother answered sometimes or  often at any of these items, the abuse variable gets a value of 1.  

For whether the father is in jail I relied on a constructed item: Cm4ffinjail, combining the reports of both father and mother. 

In general I tried to stick to items from wave 4. 

After having constructed the data, I estimated the same model as in task 1, which is a GLM.

Answers relating to the following questions/statements were selected: i)  Do you live together with this partner?; ii) Are you married to this partner?; iii) On the whole, how happy would you say you are?; and iv) I am satisfied with my life. Prior to further analysis, the data set was filtered to include only women.
Data pertaining to each participant were grouped, and mean happiness and satisfaction response values were calculated for waves in which the participant was i) living alone and unmarried, ii) cohabiting with a partner and unmarried, and iii) cohabiting with a spouse. To calculate the change in well-being between living alone and cohabitation, and between living alone and marriage (with cohabitation),  the participant’s score when living alone was subtracted from their score during each cohabitation state. Participants who did not respond to a wave whilst living alone, or did not respond to a wave whilst meeting one of the two cohabitation states, were removed from the data set. The present analysis therefore represented within-individual change in wellbeing.

After checking the assumptions of a 2x2 chi-square test (that all predicted values must be greater than 5), I utilize a chi-square test of independence using Yates’s continuity correction to test the association of condition (unique traits: positive or negative) on preference choice (original or novel group). 

The hypothesis I was testing was how large the association was between unique traits and preference choice. Because my hypothesis in particular is examining the size and magnitude of the effect, I chose to use an odds ratio test to tell the magnitude while a chi sq test can tell me about if there is an association.

The chi-square test showed a significant association between condition and choice of group chisq(1,210)=11.1, p<.001, phi=-.24). I chose this test due to the two nominal variables and the hypothesis of asking if there is an association between condition and choice. I then calculate the odds ratio to quantify the size of this association, which showed that those in which the shared traits were negative and the unique traits were positive were 62.5% less likely to pick the original group compared to those who had shared traits that were positive and unique traits that were negative (OR=.375, p<.001, 95% CI=[.215, .657])

My instructions in Task 2 stated to utilize an additional analysis in order to test my hypothesis. This was satisfied through the use of odds ratios above and beyond the chi-square test of independence that was used both by the original article as well as my own analysis. They simply test different things, so they both have uses.
