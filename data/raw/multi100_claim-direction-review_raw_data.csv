XFPK9,TERTYTCHNAYA_AmPoliSciRev_2018_9wya,increases in remittances led to an increase in trust in the president (p. 770.),"To a first approximation, an increase in remittances --- whether measured by amount, frequency, or an index --- has no effect on presidential approval. There are glimmers of evidence, in particular the positive coefficients in sections 5 and 6, which lead me to expect that a large increase in remittances may lead to a small increase in presidential approval. A more fine-grained outcome measure and larger *n* may be able to pass the arbitrary threshold of $p < 0.05$ under some specifications. Compared to the original analysis, the estimates in this re-analysis are not hugely dissimilar (with the exception of 'amount'), but are accompanied by larger standard errors. This is likely due to the absence of individual random effects which are present in the original. Yet even if greater precision yielded statistical significance, the bigger picture is that --- even in a country receiving more than 30% of its GDP in remittance flows --- an increase in remittances has essentially no effect on presidential approval.  What about the article's larger claim that changes in remittance flows (both positive and negative) affect incumbent approval? This is beyond the scope of the task assigned to me by the Multi100 project, but clearly of interest. The evidence for this claim is slightly stronger, although still not definitive. Given strong theoretical priors regarding economic voting and the evidence presented, the claim is likely true. However, the magnitude of the effect, estimated for a population which is one of the world's top recipients of remittances by GDP, is not particularly large: taking the estimate of $\widehat{\beta}=.07$ from model (2) of the published article, a one standard-deviation increase in frequency of receiving remittances ($0.07 *1.54 = 0.1078$) would predict less than one-tenth of a standard deviation increase in presidential approval ($\frac{.1078}{1.1759} \approx 0.09$). Expressed in standard deviations of the *level* of presidential trust rather than changes, a one standard-deviation increase in frequency of receiving remittances still predicts less than one-eighth of a standard deviation increase in presidential trust ($\frac{.1078}{0.9480} \approx 0.11$). Such effect sizes would be very large for a campaign ad, but seem small for such a significant economic event. In comparison, Margalit (2011) estimates that US President George W. Bush lost one vote for every 3-7 jobs eliminated by international competition during his first term (p. 178). Studying the effect of an exchange-rate shock in Poland, Ahlquist, Copelovitch, and Walter (2020) find that --- for voters who had supported one of the incumbent parties in the previous election --- exposure to this shock increased the absolute probability of voting for the challenger by from $0.1$ to $0.4$, an astonishing 300% increase (p. 916). Perhaps information about past voting behavior in the Kyrgyzstan sample would assist in discovering similarly concentrated heterogeneous effects.","In this sample, the average effect of an increase in remittances (whether a 10,000 Som increase, the logged increase, or a ten percent increase in household income) on presidential trust is approximately zero.",Yes,Fruzsi,NA
