2022.08.12. 13:09:05,LNHZJ,Barreca_JournPoliEco_2016_J999,Z3GMF,(1) Unacceptable,"The re-analysis pipeline is unacceptable for multiple reasons. First, the analyst’s description is inconsistent with the code. The text claims that indicators, state-by-month, year-by-month, and interactions of some continuous variables with month-effects are used. Presumably, the analyst meant “fixed effects” when using the word “effects”, because this is the only way that makes sense and analogous to the regression specifications in the paper. However, the code inappropriately uses the above variables as continuous regressors.

Second, the analyst plots extreme-temperature days against mortality rates by decade or sub-period, which could be helpful to reach a conclusion with respect to the testable hypothesis. However, the interpretation of the plots does not appear entirely correct, and there are no formal tests comparing regression coefficients implied by the plot.

Finally, one point that would possibly not have made the re-analysis entirely unacceptable, but which is inconsistent with the instructions of including explanations similar to a methodology section in the submitted text: the analyst uses standard errors based on an IID assumption and does not even mention the treatment of standard errors in the text, which should be standard for any analysis of panel data.",(1) It adequately follows from the results of the analysis,NA,(2) Inadequate,(1) Unacceptable,"The instructions asked the analyst to “use a 2 months temperature exposure window in your analysis”. The analyst used only the contemporaneous month. This is the decisive reason for my negative evaluation.

Other issues that, dependent on the interpretation of the instructions, may or may not have made the re-analysis unacceptable: the instructions asked to “disregard socio-economic factors and technological and public health advancements over time”. It is debatable whether the age distribution should be considered a socio-economic variable. The share of the population in the four age brackets is included in the re-analysis. Also, the exclusion of advancements over time could be interpreted in a narrow sense, i.e., to avoid explicit inclusion of measures of such advances, or more broadly as the avoidance of time trends, which would appear to me to be the natural interpretation. The re-analysis does include time trends.",(4) I executed it and I found mismatches,"“Mismatch between the results of the analysis and the reported results” may not be the right way of phrasing it, but it was the most appropriate answer to the question. The re-analysis does not explicitly mention numerical results, though it is the interpretation of results, especially of the plots produced by the code, that does not appear to be correct. Most importantly, there is a mismatch between the regression specifications in the code compared to what is described in the text. See my reply for why the Task 1 submission was unacceptable.","I do hope the peer evaluations won't be made directly available to the analysts (if at all only after all peer evaluations are in, so that they cannot be linked to one individual evaluator). Using OSF obviously enables everyone to know who one's peer evaluators are, and I suppose it is good to answer this survey in a frank manner, though the analyst might dislike it."

The main claim in the paper comes from Table 3, which uses data averaged on the participant level (across all rounds). Once averaged, the cooperation variable no longer has peaks at 0% and 100%. I am therefore not sure whether the Zero-one-inflated Beta mixed model, used by the analyst, is really necessary, instead of the regular OLS regression used in Table 3. On the other hand, I do not doubt the analyst's expertise, even though I personally do not have sufficient experience in Bayesian models to evaluate all the details of the replication analysis. 

In terms of the results, I agree with the overall evaluation that the claim is correct only when the personal characteristics are included (i.e., as in Task 2, and not in Task 1). In Task 1, if personal characteristics are not included, the p-value I get from a regular OLS regression is 0.051, so just above the common threshold. Once the personal characteristics are included in the same model, the treatment effect is much more significant. This is rather surprising since only one of the 19 added personal characteristics are statistically significant (""missing degree""), and none seem to me sufficiently important to warrant inclusion in the main analysis. If only the commonly used variables for age and gender are included, the treatment effect is still not significant.

Note that the authors do report that the results are not significant if personal characteristics are not included (footnote 11 in the paper).",NA

Thus, it is inherently difficult to decide how to model the data. The analyst decided to use a fixed effects regression to analyze the data. This approach has the downside that time-invariant predictor variables have a hard time explaining variance because the between-subjects variance is covered by the individual fixed effects. Thus, the analysis focuses on the within-subjects changes in relationship status. However, only for roughly 10% of the sample, the relationship status changes over time, while it is fixed for the remaining 90% (see Table 2, p. 2310 of the original paper). Hence, the fixed effects approach focuses only on a small subset of the sample and on longitudinal changes in the relationship status, which covers only a subset of the imprecise main claim of the paper.",(2) Inadequate,(3) Acceptable and medium quality,NA,(1) I didn’t try to execute it,NA,"For task 2, the same issue applies as explained in detail for task 1.

An inspection of the original paper reveals that the authors of the original paper expect and find an effect only in the choice condition (p. 394; e.g., figure 3). In the control condition, they neither expect nor find an effect of culture because in this condition participants do not have the task to identify choices. Accordingly, the analyses of tasks 1 and 2 of the analyst systematically underestimate the effect of culture on actions identified as choices. Because the effect is rather strong and there is no effect in the control condition, the main effect is nevertheless significant such that the analyst arrives at the same conclusion as the original authors, although an inadequate analysis was employed."

The underlying reasons for this statistical decision are understandable for two reasons: First, H1 was partially supported only using DV1, and the analyses with DV2 and DV3 did not give the same significant result. Second, the re-analyst thinks that the effect sizes in significant analyses are too small, and the reason for significant results is the large sample. Although the first reason is discussible, I do not agree with the second, thinking it is not a problem but a good sampling practice considering power.

I executed only code for Task 2 (in R), because I do not have license for Stata (used in Task 1). The code did not run at the first attempt because of some variable names, but it might just be different versions of the software automatically recoding empty spaces in different ways; once corrected, there were no mismatches or errors. In general, it seems that the analyst has mostly followed the analyses found in the original paper. However, his/her interpretation, criticism of the original paper, and conclusions, are absolutely adequate."

The ID of co-analyst is: UY3WI

Furthermore, It is worth mentioning that I agree with the analyst that ""Senators do report more anti-immigration actions when they receive anti-immigration letters and more pro-immigration actions when receiving pro-immigration letters"". 

However, I´m not sure concerning the part: ""...based on the coding of the Anti-Pro variable in the footnote of Table 2, I find that opposite result…”

To elaborate further: 
The analysist mentioned that: “(though the same percentages) with 19.7% and 42.9% more pro-immigration (-1 coding) actions for pro- and anti-immigration letters respectively""...

It is true that, 
(A) based on the analysis script, it seems that anti-immigrant actions are coded as -1 in dataset (or that authors of original article reported it wrongly in Table 2, column 3 as suggested by analyst); and 
(B) in the footnote of the Table 2 in the article, it is mentioned that: ""The “Anti − Pro” measure is coded as 1 if a senator mentioned an anti-immigration action"". 

However, table 2 (even problematic column 3), seems to be ok (so, after Anti-immigration letter, 55,4% of senators mentioned Anti-immigration actions, but only 12,5 mentioned Pro-immigration actions, leading to 42,9% difference in favor of Anti-immigration letters in this condition; and after pro-immigration letter, 42,9% mentioned Anti-immigration letter, while only 23,2 mentioned pro-immigration actions - so there is still more % of people mentioning anti-immigration actions (in particular 19,7%). 

Therefore, (1) as sentence in a footnote could relate to rationale for a table rather than analysis pipeline and dataset per se; and (2) codebook is not available to check it more thoroughly, I can not say for sure if:  
(A) the results reported by analysit are in fact opposite to what is reported in article, or 
(B) there is simply mismatch (e.g., in understanding of the footnote of Table 2 by analyst or in coding of variable in dataset). 

Thus, I don´t have enought information to provide valid judgment whether the statement: “The results show evidence for opposite relationship/effect as described in the claim” is true or not (I´ve marked 2 - ineadequate as the answer in the question ""Please indicate whether the co-analyst’s self-categorization of the result is adequate"" just to point out to the potential problem as there was no option ""I´m not sure based on evidence available to me)."

A 3-way ANOVA was performed. The 3-way ANOVA tests whether the experimental condition, gender and marital status affect the level of the reported desired salary. The 3-way ANOVA did not find evidence that these variables affect the reported desired salary. However, this is not exactly the claim that should be tested. The 3-way ANOVA includes data from men and married women, which are irrelevant to the claim tested.

It would have been better to only use the data from single female and then look at whether the experimental condition changes the reported desired salaries. Including the data from men and married women adds noise and makes the relationship weaker.",(2) Inadequate,(2) Acceptable but low quality,NA,(1) I didn’t try to execute it,NA,"My ID is 03TOT
