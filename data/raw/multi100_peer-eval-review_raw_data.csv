LNHZJ,Z3GMF,Barreca_JournPoliEco_2016_J999,task1_pipeline_acceptable,(1) Unacceptable,"The re-analysis pipeline is unacceptable for multiple reasons. First, the analyst’s description is inconsistent with the code. The text claims that indicators, state-by-month, year-by-month, and interactions of some continuous variables with month-effects are used. Presumably, the analyst meant “fixed effects” when using the word “effects”, because this is the only way that makes sense and analogous to the regression specifications in the paper. However, the code inappropriately uses the above variables as continuous regressors.

Second, the analyst plots extreme-temperature days against mortality rates by decade or sub-period, which could be helpful to reach a conclusion with respect to the testable hypothesis. However, the interpretation of the plots does not appear entirely correct, and there are no formal tests comparing regression coefficients implied by the plot.

Finally, one point that would possibly not have made the re-analysis entirely unacceptable, but which is inconsistent with the instructions of including explanations similar to a methodology section in the submitted text: the analyst uses standard errors based on an IID assumption and does not even mention the treatment of standard errors in the text, which should be standard for any analysis of panel data.",Keep,"In response to the peer evaluator's first comment: The evaluator appears to be arguing here that using specific variables as continuous regressors within the model is unacceptable because it is does not align with the original paper. Whilst this could be considered a sub-optimal way of testing the claim, analysts are asked to perform an independent analysis, and this could be considered an analytical decision which is at the discretion of the analyst.

In response to the peer evaluator's second comment: It is not clear in this case how the analyst has misinterpreted their plot. Analysts in Task 1 are required to draw a single conclusion, so the lack of tests described by the evaluator would not be enough to render this analysis unacceptable. 

In response to the peer evaluator's third comment: The evaluator points out something that the analyst fails to mention in their description of the analysis (as would be expected in a methodology section). However, the evaluator concedes that this alone is unlikely to render the analysis unacceptable.",(2) Acceptable but low quality

Other issues that, dependent on the interpretation of the instructions, may or may not have made the re-analysis unacceptable: the instructions asked to “disregard socio-economic factors and technological and public health advancements over time”. It is debatable whether the age distribution should be considered a socio-economic variable. The share of the population in the four age brackets is included in the re-analysis. Also, the exclusion of advancements over time could be interpreted in a narrow sense, i.e., to avoid explicit inclusion of measures of such advances, or more broadly as the avoidance of time trends, which would appear to me to be the natural interpretation. The re-analysis does include time trends.",Keep,"The analyst does not explicitly state that they used a 2-month temperature exposure window in their submission, however there are 6 instructions for the Barreca paper, many of which the analyst has clearly adhered to.

The main claim in the paper comes from Table 3, which uses data averaged on the participant level (across all rounds). Once averaged, the cooperation variable no longer has peaks at 0% and 100%. I am therefore not sure whether the Zero-one-inflated Beta mixed model, used by the analyst, is really necessary, instead of the regular OLS regression used in Table 3. On the other hand, I do not doubt the analyst's expertise, even though I personally do not have sufficient experience in Bayesian models to evaluate all the details of the replication analysis. 

In terms of the results, I agree with the overall evaluation that the claim is correct only when the personal characteristics are included (i.e., as in Task 2, and not in Task 1). In Task 1, if personal characteristics are not included, the p-value I get from a regular OLS regression is 0.051, so just above the common threshold. Once the personal characteristics are included in the same model, the treatment effect is much more significant. This is rather surprising since only one of the 19 added personal characteristics are statistically significant (""""missing degree""""), and none seem to me sufficiently important to warrant inclusion in the main analysis. If only the commonly used variables for age and gender are included, the treatment effect is still not significant.

This approach has the downside that time-invariant predictor variables have a hard time explaining variance because the between-subjects variance is covered by the individual fixed effects.

However, only for roughly 10% of the sample, the relationship status changes over time, while it is fixed for the remaining 90% (see Table 2, p. 2310 of the original paper).

However, I´m not sure concerning the part: ""...based on the coding of the Anti-Pro variable in the footnote of Table 2, I find that opposite result…”

To elaborate further: 
The analysist mentioned that: “(though the same percentages) with 19.7% and 42.9% more pro-immigration (-1 coding) actions for pro- and anti-immigration letters respectively""...

It is true that, 
(A) based on the analysis script, it seems that anti-immigrant actions are coded as -1 in dataset (or that authors of original article reported it wrongly in Table 2, column 3 as suggested by analyst); and 
(B) in the footnote of the Table 2 in the article, it is mentioned that: ""The “Anti − Pro” measure is coded as 1 if a senator mentioned an anti-immigration action"". 

However, table 2 (even problematic column 3), seems to be ok (so, after Anti-immigration letter, 55,4% of senators mentioned Anti-immigration actions, but only 12,5 mentioned Pro-immigration actions, leading to 42,9% difference in favor of Anti-immigration letters in this condition; and after pro-immigration letter, 42,9% mentioned Anti-immigration letter, while only 23,2 mentioned pro-immigration actions - so there is still more % of people mentioning anti-immigration actions (in particular 19,7%). 

Therefore, (1) as sentence in a footnote could relate to rationale for a table rather than analysis pipeline and dataset per se; and (2) codebook is not available to check it more thoroughly, I can not say for sure if:  
(A) the results reported by analysit are in fact opposite to what is reported in article, or 
(B) there is simply mismatch (e.g., in understanding of the footnote of Table 2 by analyst or in coding of variable in dataset). 

Thus, I don´t have enought information to provide valid judgment whether the statement: “The results show evidence for opposite relationship/effect as described in the claim” is true or not (I´ve marked 2 - ineadequate as the answer in the question ""Please indicate whether the co-analyst’s self-categorization of the result is adequate"" just to point out to the potential problem as there was no option ""I´m not sure based on evidence available to me).",Keep,Potential differences in test statistics can be considered inconsequential,(1) Adequate
