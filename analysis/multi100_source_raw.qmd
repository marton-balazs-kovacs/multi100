## Renaming variables

```{r}
colnames(task1) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(task1), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(task1_codebook$new_names), task1_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(task2) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(task2), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(task2_codebook$new_names), task2_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(all_people) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(all_people), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(all_people_codebook$new_names), all_people_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(all_paper) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(all_paper), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(all_paper_codebook$new_names), all_paper_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(master) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(master), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(master_codebook$new_names), master_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(original_effect_sizes) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(original_effect_sizes), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(original_effect_sizes_codebook$new_names), original_effect_sizes_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(reanalyzed_effect_sizes) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(reanalyzed_effect_sizes), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(reanalyzed_effect_sizes_codebook$new_names), reanalyzed_effect_sizes_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(peer_eval) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(peer_eval), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(peer_eval_codebook$new_names), peer_eval_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(peer_eval_review) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(peer_eval_review), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(peer_eval_review_codebook$new_names), peer_eval_review_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(analyst_payments) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(analyst_payments), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(analyst_payments_codebook$new_names), analyst_payments_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(claim_direction_review) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(claim_direction_review), 
  !!!setNames(as.character(claim_direction_review_codebook$new_names), claim_direction_review_codebook$variable_names)
)

colnames(non_detailed_responses) <- dplyr::recode(
  colnames(non_detailed_responses),

```

## Dropping variables that contain personal information

Some variables contain personal information that we cannot share openly. We will drop these variables here for the further analysis.

```{r}
task1 <- 
  task1 |>  
  select(-email)

task2 <- 
  task2 |> 
  select(-email)

all_people <- 
  all_people |> 
  select(
    -signup_email,
    -signup_comment
    )

peer_eval <- 
  peer_eval |>  
  select(-evaluator_email)

analyst_payments <-
  analyst_payments |> 
  select(
    -signup_email
  )
```

## Fixing data read errors

In the source datasets in gsheets format, in some cases the decimal points are denoted by a comma, while in other cases they are denoted by a dot. We will change the comma to a dot in all cases.

```{r}
original_effect_sizes <-
  original_effect_sizes |> 
  mutate(
   original_statistic_report = gsub(",", ".", original_statistic_report),
   original_correlation_coef = gsub(",", ".", original_correlation_coef),
   original_cohens_d = gsub(",", ".", original_cohens_d),
   original_degrees_of_freedom_1 = gsub(",", ".", original_degrees_of_freedom_1),
   original_degrees_of_freedom_2 = gsub(",", ".", original_degrees_of_freedom_2),
  )

reanalyzed_effect_sizes <-
  reanalyzed_effect_sizes |>
  mutate(
    reanalysis_statistic_report = gsub(",", ".", reanalysis_statistic_report),
    reanalysis_degrees_of_freedom_1 = gsub(",", ".", reanalysis_degrees_of_freedom_1),
    reanalysis_degrees_of_freedom_2 = gsub(",", ".", reanalysis_degrees_of_freedom_2),
  )
```

## Save raw dataset

```{r}
readr::write_csv(task1, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_task1_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(task2, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_task2_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(all_people, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_all-people_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(all_paper, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_all-paper_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(master, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_master_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(original_effect_sizes, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_original-effect-sizes_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(reanalyzed_effect_sizes, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_reanalyzed-effect-sizes_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(peer_eval, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_peer-eval_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(peer_eval_review, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_peer-eval-review_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(analyst_payments, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_analyst-payments_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(claim_direction_review, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_claim-direction-review_raw_data.csv"))

readr::write_csv(non_detailed_responses, here("multi100/data/raw/multi100_non-detailed-responses_raw_data.csv"))
```
